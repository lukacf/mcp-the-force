# Pre-Release Cleanup Summary

## Documentation Overhaul Completed

### High Priority Documentation Fixes

1. **Deleted misleading API documentation**
   - Removed `docs/API-REFERENCE.md` which was a copy of OpenAI's official API docs

2. **README.md Comprehensive Update**
   - **Available Tools section**: Rewritten with accurate tool listings generated from adapter blueprints
   - **Quick Start section**: Updated to use `mcp-config init` workflow with proper secrets.yaml handling
   - **Context Management section**: Added detailed explanation of `context`/`priority_context` parameters and Stable-Inline List feature
   - **Session Management section**: Updated to describe UnifiedSessionCache with 6-month TTL
   - **Claude Code Integration**: Changed all "Claude Desktop" references to "Claude Code" with proper `claude mcp add-json` commands
   - **Configuration Reference**: Added comprehensive tables for key settings

3. **Created CONFIGURATION.md**
   - Complete reference for all configuration settings
   - Organized by sections matching the Settings model structure
   - Includes YAML paths, environment variables, types, defaults, and descriptions
   - Clear precedence explanation (env vars > secrets.yaml > config.yaml > defaults)

4. **Updated config.yaml.example**
   - Regenerated to match current Settings model
   - Added missing security path blacklist entries
   - Added notes about unimplemented providers (anthropic, litellm)

5. **Updated CLAUDE.md**
   - Corrected tool list with actual available tools from all adapters
   - Fixed tool names (underscores instead of hyphens)
   - Updated project overview to include xAI Grok models
   - Corrected architecture descriptions
   - Updated configuration key settings
   - Fixed session TTL from "1 hour" to "6 months"

### Archived Obsolete Documentation
Moved completed development docs to `docs/archive/`:
- context-vdb-rewrite.md
- grok-adapter.md
- litellm-refactor.md
- logging-rewrite.md
- loiter-killer-architecture.md (service has been removed, functionality integrated into MCP server)
- solved-hanging-issue.md
- victoria-log-issues.md

### CONTRIBUTING.md Status
- Architecture section already reflects protocol-based design
- "Adding a New Adapter" guide already documents the correct protocol pattern
- No changes needed

## Code Fixes Completed Earlier

1. **Fixed placeholder author name** in pyproject.toml
2. **Cleaned up debug code** in server.py for production readiness
3. **Removed Loiter Killer service entirely** - vector store lifecycle management is now integrated directly into the MCP server with automatic cleanup

## Repository Status

The repository documentation is now ready for public release with:
- Accurate, up-to-date documentation reflecting the actual implementation
- Clear configuration instructions and comprehensive reference
- Proper tool listings and capabilities
- Archived obsolete development docs
- No misleading or outdated information
