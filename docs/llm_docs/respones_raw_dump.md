Text generation and prompting
=============================

Learn how to prompt a model to generate text.

With the OpenAI API, you can use a [large language model](/docs/models) to generate text from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). Models can generate almost any kind of text response—like code, mathematical equations, structured JSON data, or human-like prose.

Here's a simple example using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses).

Generate text from a simple prompt

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
    }'
```

An array of content generated by the model is in the `output` property of the response. In this simple example, we have just one output which looks like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "msg_67b73f697ba4819183a15cc17d011509",
        "type": "message",
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "output_text",
                "text": "Under the soft glow of the moon, Luna the unicorn danced through fields of twinkling stardust, leaving trails of dreams for every child asleep.",
                "annotations": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

**The `output` array often has more than one item in it!** It can contain tool calls, data about reasoning tokens generated by [reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning), and other items. It is not safe to assume that the model's text output is present at `output[0].content[0].text`.

Some of our [official SDKs](/docs/libraries) include an `output_text` property on model responses for convenience, which aggregates all text outputs from the model into a single string. This may be useful as a shortcut to access text output from the model.

In addition to plain text, you can also have the model return structured data in JSON format - this feature is called [**Structured Outputs**](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Choosing a model
----------------

A key choice to make when generating content through the API is which model you want to use - the `model` parameter of the code samples above. [You can find a full listing of available models here](/docs/models). Here are a few factors to consider when choosing a model for text generation.

*   **[Reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning)** generate an internal chain of thought to analyze the input prompt, and excel at understanding complex tasks and multi-step planning. They are also generally slower and more expensive to use than GPT models.
*   **GPT models** are fast, cost-efficient, and highly intelligent, but benefit from more explicit instructions around how to accomplish tasks.
*   **Large and small (mini or nano) models** offer trade-offs for speed, cost, and intelligence. Large models are more effective at understanding prompts and solving problems across domains, while small models are generally faster and cheaper to use.

When in doubt, [`gpt-4.1`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1) offers a solid combination of intelligence, speed, and cost effectiveness.

Prompt engineering
------------------

**Prompt engineering** is the process of writing effective instructions for a model, such that it consistently generates content that meets your requirements.

Because the content generated from a model is non-deterministic, it is a combination of art and science to build a prompt that will generate content in the format you want. However, there are a number of techniques and best practices you can apply to consistently get good results from a model.

Some prompt engineering techniques will work with every model, like using message roles. But different model types (like reasoning versus GPT models) might need to be prompted differently to produce the best results. Even different snapshots of models within the same family could produce different results. So as you are building more complex applications, we strongly recommend that you:

*   Pin your production applications to specific [model snapshots](/docs/models) (like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` for example) to ensure consistent behavior.
*   Build [evals](/docs/guides/evals) that will measure the behavior of your prompts, so that you can monitor the performance of your prompts as you iterate on them, or when you change and upgrade model versions.

Now, let's examine some tools and techniques available to you to construct prompts.

Message roles and instruction following
---------------------------------------

You can provide instructions to the model with [differing levels of authority](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#chain_of_command) using the `instructions` API parameter or **message roles**.

The `instructions` parameter gives the model high-level instructions on how it should behave while generating a response, including tone, goals, and examples of correct responses. Any instructions provided this way will take priority over a prompt in the `input` parameter.

Generate text with instructions

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    instructions: "Talk like a pirate.",
    input: "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    instructions="Talk like a pirate.",
    input="Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "instructions": "Talk like a pirate.",
        "input": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
    }'
```

The example above is roughly equivalent to using the following input messages in the `input` array:

Generate text with messages using different roles

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
        {
            role: "developer",
            content: "Talk like a pirate."
        },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "developer",
            "content": "Talk like a pirate."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": [
            {
                "role": "developer",
                "content": "Talk like a pirate."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

Note that the `instructions` parameter only applies to the current response generation request. If you are [managing conversation state](/docs/guides/conversation-state) with the `previous_response_id` parameter, the `instructions` used on previous turns will not be present in the context.

The [OpenAI model spec](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#chain_of_command) describes how our models give different levels of priority to messages with different roles.

|developer|user|assistant|
|---|---|---|
|developer messages are instructions provided by the application developer, prioritized ahead of user messages.|user messages are instructions provided by an end user, prioritized behind developer messages.|Messages generated by the model have the assistant role.|

A multi-turn conversation may consist of several messages of these types, along with other content types provided by both you and the model. Learn more about [managing conversation state here](/docs/guides/conversation-state).

You could think about `developer` and `user` messages like a function and its arguments in a programming language.

*   `developer` messages provide the system's rules and business logic, like a function definition.
*   `user` messages provide inputs and configuration to which the `developer` message instructions are applied, like arguments to a function.

Reusable prompts
----------------

In the OpenAI dashboard, you can develop reusable [prompts](/playground/prompts) that you can use in API requests, rather than specifying the content of prompts in code. This way, you can more easily build and evaluate your prompts, and deploy improved versions of your prompts without changing your integration code.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Create a reusable prompt** in the [dashboard](/playground/prompts) with placeholders like `{{customer_name}}`.
2.  **Use the prompt** in your API request with the `prompt` parameter. The prompt parameter object has three properties you can configure:
    *   `id` — Unique identifier of your prompt, found in the dashboard
    *   `version` — A specific version of your prompt (defaults to the "current" version as specified in the dashboard)
    *   `variables` — A map of values to substitute in for variables in your prompt. The substitution values can either be strings, or other Response input message types like `input_image` or `input_file`. [See the full API reference](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

String variables

Generate text with a prompt template

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    prompt: {
        id: "pmpt_abc123",
        version: "2",
        variables: {
            customer_name: "Jane Doe",
            product: "40oz juice box"
        }
    }
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    prompt={
        "id": "pmpt_abc123",
        "version": "2",
        "variables": {
            "customer_name": "Jane Doe",
            "product": "40oz juice box"
        }
    }
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "prompt": {
      "id": "pmpt_abc123",
      "version": "2",
      "variables": {
        "customer_name": "Jane Doe",
        "product": "40oz juice box"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Variables with file input

Prompt template with file input variable

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

// Upload a PDF we will reference in the prompt variables
const file = await client.files.create({
    file: fs.createReadStream("draconomicon.pdf"),
    purpose: "user_data",
});

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    prompt: {
        id: "pmpt_abc123",
        variables: {
            topic: "Dragons",
            reference_pdf: {
                type: "input_file",
                file_id: file.id,
            },
        },
    },
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
import openai, pathlib

client = openai.OpenAI()

# Upload a PDF we will reference in the variables
file = client.files.create(
    file=open("draconomicon.pdf", "rb"),
    purpose="user_data",
)

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    prompt={
        "id": "pmpt_abc123",
        "variables": {
            "topic": "Dragons",
            "reference_pdf": {
                "type": "input_file",
                "file_id": file.id,
            },
        },
    },
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
# Assume you have already uploaded the PDF and obtained FILE_ID
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses   -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "prompt": {
      "id": "pmpt_abc123",
      "variables": {
        "topic": "Dragons",
        "reference_pdf": {
          "type": "input_file",
          "file_id": "file-abc123"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Message formatting with Markdown and XML
----------------------------------------

When writing `developer` and `user` messages, you can help the model understand logical boundaries of your prompt and context data using a combination of [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) formatting and [XML tags](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/).

Markdown headers and lists can be helpful to mark distinct sections of a prompt, and to communicate hierarchy to the model. They can also potentially make your prompts more readable during development. XML tags can help delineate where one piece of content (like a supporting document used for reference) begins and ends. XML attributes can also be used to define metadata about content in the prompt that can be referenced by your instructions.

In general, a developer message will contain the following sections, usually in this order (though the exact optimal content and order may vary by which model you are using):

*   **Identity:** Describe the purpose, communication style, and high-level goals of the assistant.
*   **Instructions:** Provide guidance to the model on how to generate the response you want. What rules should it follow? What should the model do, and what should the model never do? This section could contain many subsections as relevant for your use case, like how the model should [call custom functions](/docs/guides/function-calling).
*   **Examples:** Provide examples of possible inputs, along with the desired output from the model.
*   **Context:** Give the model any additional information it might need to generate a response, like private/proprietary data outside its training data, or any other data you know will be particularly relevant. This content is usually best positioned near the end of your prompt, as you may include different context for different generation requests.

Below is an example of using Markdown and XML tags to construct a `developer` message with distinct sections and supporting examples.

Example prompt

A developer message for code generation

```text
# Identity

You are coding assistant that helps enforce the use of snake case 
variables in JavaScript code, and writing code that will run in 
Internet Explorer version 6.

# Instructions

* When defining variables, use snake case names (e.g. my_variable) 
  instead of camel case names (e.g. myVariable).
* To support old browsers, declare variables using the older 
  "var" keyword.
* Do not give responses with Markdown formatting, just return 
  the code as requested.

# Examples

<user_query>
How do I declare a string variable for a first name?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
var first_name = "Anna";
</assistant_response>
```

API request

Send a prompt to generate code through the API

```javascript
import fs from "fs/promises";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const instructions = await fs.readFile("prompt.txt", "utf-8");

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    instructions,
    input: "How would I declare a variable for a last name?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

with open("prompt.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    instructions = f.read()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    instructions=instructions,
    input="How would I declare a variable for a last name?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "instructions": "'"$(< prompt.txt)"'",
    "input": "How would I declare a variable for a last name?"
  }'
```

#### Save on cost and latency with prompt caching

When constructing a message, you should try and keep content that you expect to use over and over in your API requests at the beginning of your prompt, **and** among the first API parameters you pass in the JSON request body to [Chat Completions](/docs/api-reference/chat) or [Responses](/docs/api-reference/responses). This enables you to maximize cost and latency savings from [prompt caching](/docs/guides/prompt-caching).

Few-shot learning
-----------------

Few-shot learning lets you steer a large language model toward a new task by including a handful of input/output examples in the prompt, rather than [fine-tuning](/docs/guides/model-optimization) the model. The model implicitly "picks up" the pattern from those examples and applies it to a prompt. When providing examples, try to show a diverse range of possible inputs with the desired outputs.

Typically, you will provide examples as part of a `developer` message in your API request. Here's an example `developer` message containing examples that show a model how to classify positive or negative customer service reviews.

```text
# Identity

You are a helpful assistant that labels short product reviews as
Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

# Instructions

* Only output a single word in your response with no additional formatting
  or commentary.
* Your response should only be one of the words "Positive", "Negative", or
  "Neutral" depending on the sentiment of the product review you are given.

# Examples

<product_review id="example-1">
I absolutely love this headphones — sound quality is amazing!
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-1">
Positive
</assistant_response>

<product_review id="example-2">
Battery life is okay, but the ear pads feel cheap.
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-2">
Neutral
</assistant_response>

<product_review id="example-3">
Terrible customer service, I'll never buy from them again.
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-3">
Negative
</assistant_response>
```

Include relevant context information
------------------------------------

It is often useful to include additional context information the model can use to generate a response within the prompt you give the model. There are a few common reasons why you might do this:

*   To give the model access to proprietary data, or any other data outside the data set the model was trained on.
*   To constrain the model's response to a specific set of resources that you have determined will be most beneficial.

The technique of adding additional relevant context to the model generation request is sometimes called **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. You can add additional context to the prompt in many different ways, from querying a vector database and including the text you get back into a prompt, or by using OpenAI's built-in [file search tool](/docs/guides/tools-file-search) to generate content based on uploaded documents.

#### Planning for the context window

Models can only handle so much data within the context they consider during a generation request. This memory limit is called a **context window**, which is defined in terms of [tokens](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-tokens-explained) (chunks of data you pass in, from text to images).

Models have different context window sizes from the low 100k range up to one million tokens for newer GPT-4.1 models. [Refer to the model docs](/docs/models) for specific context window sizes per model.

Prompting GPT-4.1 models
------------------------

GPT models like [`gpt-4.1`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1) benefit from precise instructions that explicitly provide the logic and data required to complete the task in the prompt. GPT-4.1 in particular is highly steerable and responsive to well-specified prompts. To get the most out of GPT-4.1, refer to the prompting guide in the cookbook.

#### GPT-4.1 prompting best practices

While the [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide) has the best and most comprehensive guidance for prompting this model, here are a few best practices to keep in mind.

Building agentic workflows

### System Prompt Reminders

In order to best utilize the agentic capabilities of GPT-4.1, we recommend including three key types of reminders in all agent prompts for persistence, tool calling, and planning. As a whole, we find that these three instructions transform the model's behavior from chatbot-like into a much more "eager" agent, driving the interaction forward autonomously and independently. Here are a few examples:

```text
## PERSISTENCE
You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely
resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only
terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.

## TOOL CALLING
If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to
the user's request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant
information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.

## PLANNING
You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect
extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this
entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your
ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
```

#### Tool Calls

Compared to previous models, GPT-4.1 has undergone more training on effectively utilizing tools passed as arguments in an OpenAI API request. We encourage developers to exclusively use the tools field of API requests to pass tools for best understanding and performance, rather than manually injecting tool descriptions into the system prompt and writing a separate parser for tool calls, as some have reported doing in the past.

#### Diff Generation

Correct diffs are critical for coding applications, so we've significantly improved performance at this task for GPT-4.1. In our cookbook, we open-source a recommended diff format on which GPT-4.1 has been extensively trained. That said, the model should generalize to any well-specified format.

Using long context

GPT-4.1 has a performant 1M token input context window, and will be useful for a variety of long context tasks, including structured document parsing, re-ranking, selecting relevant information while ignoring irrelevant context, and performing multi-hop reasoning using context.

#### Optimal Context Size

We show perfect performance at needle-in-a-haystack evals up to our full context size, and we've observed very strong performance at complex tasks with a mix of relevant and irrelevant code and documents in the range of hundreds of thousands of tokens.

#### Delimiters

We tested a variety of delimiters for separating context provided to the model against our long context evals. Briefly, XML and the format demonstrated by Lee et al. ([ref](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13121)) tend to perform well, while JSON performed worse for this task. See our cookbook for prompt examples.

#### Prompt Organization

Especially in long context usage, placement of instructions and context can substantially impact performance. In our experiments, we found that it was optimal to put critical instructions, including the user query, at both the top and the bottom of the prompt; this elicited marginally better performance from the model than putting them only at the top, and much better performance than only at the bottom.

Prompting for chain of thought

As mentioned above, GPT-4.1 isn't a reasoning model, but prompting the model to think step by step (called "chain of thought") can be an effective way for a model to break down problems into more manageable pieces. The model has been trained to perform well at agentic reasoning and real-world problem solving, so it shouldn't require much prompting to do well.

We recommend starting with this basic chain-of-thought instruction at the end of your prompt:

```text
First, think carefully step by step about what documents are needed to answer the query. Then, print out the TITLE and ID of each document. Then, format the IDs into a list.
```

From there, you should improve your CoT prompt by auditing failures in your particular examples and evals, and addressing systematic planning and reasoning errors with more explicit instructions. See our cookbook for a prompt example demonstrating a more opinionated reasoning strategy.

Instruction following

GPT-4.1 exhibits outstanding instruction-following performance, which developers can leverage to precisely shape and control the outputs for their particular use cases. However, since the model follows instructions more literally than its predecessors, may need to provide more explicit specification around what to do or not do, and existing prompts optimized for other models may not immediately work with this model.

#### Recommended Workflow

Here is our recommended workflow for developing and debugging instructions in prompts:

*   Start with an overall "Response Rules" or "Instructions" section with high-level guidance and bullet points.
*   If you'd like to change a more specific behavior, add a section containing more details for that category, like `## Sample Phrases`.
*   If there are specific steps you'd like the model to follow in its workflow, add an ordered list and instruct the model to follow these steps.
*   If behavior still isn't working as expected, check for conflicting, underspecified, or incorrect instructions and examples. If there are conflicting instructions, GPT-4.1 tends to follow the one closer to the end of the prompt.
*   Add examples that demonstrate desired behavior; ensure that any important behavior demonstrated in your examples are also cited in your rules.
*   It's generally not necessary to use all-caps or other incentives like bribes or tips, but developers can experiment with this for extra emphasis if so desired.

#### Common Failure Modes

These failure modes are not unique to GPT-4.1, but we share them here for general awareness and ease of debugging.

*   Instructing a model to always follow a specific behavior can occasionally induce adverse effects. For instance, if told "you must call a tool before responding to the user," models may hallucinate tool inputs or call the tool with null values if they do not have enough information. Adding "if you don't have enough information to call the tool, ask the user for the information you need" should mitigate this.
*   When provided sample phrases, models can use those quotes verbatim and start to sound repetitive to users. Ensure you instruct the model to vary them as necessary.
*   Without specific instructions, some models can be eager to provide additional prose to explain their decisions, or output more formatting in responses than may be desired. Provide instructions and potentially examples to help mitigate.

See our cookbook for an example customer service prompt that demonstrates these principles.

Prompting reasoning models
--------------------------

There are some differences to consider when prompting a [reasoning model](/docs/guides/reasoning) versus prompting a GPT model. Generally speaking, reasoning models will provide better results on tasks with only high-level guidance. This differs from GPT models, which benefit from very precise instructions.

You could think about the difference between reasoning and GPT models like this.

*   A reasoning model is like a senior co-worker. You can give them a goal to achieve and trust them to work out the details.
*   A GPT model is like a junior coworker. They'll perform best with explicit instructions to create a specific output.

In this guide, you will learn about building applications involving images with the OpenAI API. If you know what you want to build, find your use case below to get started. If you're not sure where to start, continue reading to get an overview.

### A tour of image-related use cases

Recent language models can process image inputs and analyze them — a capability known as **vision**. With `gpt-image-1`, they can both analyze visual inputs and create images.

The OpenAI API offers several endpoints to process images as input or generate them as output, enabling you to build powerful multimodal applications.

|API|Supported use cases|
|---|---|
|Responses API|Analyze images and use them as input and/or generate images as output|
|Images API|Generate images as output, optionally using images as input|
|Chat Completions API|Analyze images and use them as input to generate text or audio|

To learn more about the input and output modalities supported by our models, refer to our [models page](/docs/models).

Generate or edit images
-----------------------

You can generate or edit images using the Image API or the Responses API.

Our latest image generation model, `gpt-image-1`, is a natively multimodal large language model. It can understand text and images and leverage its broad world knowledge to generate images with better instruction following and contextual awareness.

In contrast, we also offer specialized image generation models - DALL·E 2 and 3 - which don't have the same inherent understanding of the world as GPT Image.

Generate images with Responses

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    input: "Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
    tools: [{type: "image_generation"}],
});

// Save the image to a file
const imageData = response.output
  .filter((output) => output.type === "image_generation_call")
  .map((output) => output.result);

if (imageData.length > 0) {
  const imageBase64 = imageData[0];
  const fs = await import("fs");
  fs.writeFileSync("cat_and_otter.png", Buffer.from(imageBase64, "base64"));
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI() 

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input="Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation"}],
)

// Save the image to a file
image_data = [
    output.result
    for output in response.output
    if output.type == "image_generation_call"
]

if image_data:
    image_base64 = image_data[0]
    with open("cat_and_otter.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(image_base64))
```

You can learn more about image generation in our [Image generation](/docs/guides/image-generation) guide.

### Using world knowledge for image generation

The difference between DALL·E models and GPT Image is that a natively multimodal language model can use its visual understanding of the world to generate lifelike images including real-life details without a reference.

For example, if you prompt GPT Image to generate an image of a glass cabinet with the most popular semi-precious stones, the model knows enough to select gemstones like amethyst, rose quartz, jade, etc, and depict them in a realistic way.

Analyze images
--------------

**Vision** is the ability for a model to "see" and understand images. If there is text in an image, the model can also understand the text. It can understand most visual elements, including objects, shapes, colors, and textures, even if there are some [limitations](#limitations).

### Giving a model images as input

You can provide images as input to generation requests in multiple ways:

*   By providing a fully qualified URL to an image file
*   By providing an image as a Base64-encoded data URL
*   By providing a file ID (created with the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files))

You can provide multiple images as input in a single request by including multiple images in the `content` array, but keep in mind that [images count as tokens](#calculating-costs) and will be billed accordingly.

Passing a URL

Analyze the content of an image

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    input: [{
        role: "user",
        content: [
            { type: "input_text", text: "what's in this image?" },
            {
                type: "input_image",
                image_url: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
            },
        ],
    }],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?"},
            {
                "type": "input_image",
                "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
            },
        ],
    }],
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "input": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {"type": "input_text", "text": "what is in this image?"},

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Passing a Base64 encoded image

Analyze the content of an image

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const imagePath = "path_to_your_image.jpg";
const base64Image = fs.readFileSync(imagePath, "base64");

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: [
                { type: "input_text", text: "what's in this image?" },
                {
                    type: "input_image",
                    image_url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${base64Image}`,
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Function to encode the image
def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

# Path to your image
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"

# Getting the Base64 string
base64_image = encode_image(image_path)

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                { "type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?" },
                {
                    "type": "input_image",
                    "image_url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Passing a file ID

Analyze the content of an image

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import fs from "fs";

const openai = new OpenAI();

// Function to create a file with the Files API
async function createFile(filePath) {
  const fileContent = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
  const result = await openai.files.create({
    file: fileContent,
    purpose: "vision",
  });
  return result.id;
}

// Getting the file ID
const fileId = await createFile("path_to_your_image.jpg");

const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
  input: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: [
        { type: "input_text", text: "what's in this image?" },
        {
          type: "input_image",
          file_id: fileId,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Function to create a file with the Files API
def create_file(file_path):
  with open(file_path, "rb") as file_content:
    result = client.files.create(
        file=file_content,
        purpose="vision",
    )
    return result.id

# Getting the file ID
file_id = create_file("path_to_your_image.jpg")

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?"},
            {
                "type": "input_image",
                "file_id": file_id,
            },
        ],
    }],
)

print(response.output_text)
```

### Image input requirements

Input images must meet the following requirements to be used in the API.

|Supported file types|PNG (.png)JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg)WEBP (.webp)Non-animated GIF (.gif)|
|Size limits|Up to 50 MB total payload size per requestUp to 500 individual image inputs per request|
|Other requirements|No watermarks or logosNo NSFW contentClear enough for a human to understand|

### Specify image input detail level

The `detail` parameter tells the model what level of detail to use when processing and understanding the image (`low`, `high`, or `auto` to let the model decide). If you skip the parameter, the model will use `auto`.

```plain
{
    "type": "input_image",
    "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
    "detail": "high"
}
```

You can save tokens and speed up responses by using `"detail": "low"`. This lets the model process the image with a budget of 85 tokens. The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image. This is fine if your use case doesn't require the model to see with high-resolution detail (for example, if you're asking about the dominant shape or color in the image).

On the other hand, you can use `"detail": "high"` if you want the model to have a better understanding of the image.

Read more about calculating image processing costs in the [Calculating costs](#calculating-costs) section below.

Limitations
-----------

While models with vision capabilities are powerful and can be used in many situations, it's important to understand the limitations of these models. Here are some known limitations:

*   **Medical images**: The model is not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images like CT scans and shouldn't be used for medical advice.
*   **Non-English**: The model may not perform optimally when handling images with text of non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Korean.
*   **Small text**: Enlarge text within the image to improve readability, but avoid cropping important details.
*   **Rotation**: The model may misinterpret rotated or upside-down text and images.
*   **Visual elements**: The model may struggle to understand graphs or text where colors or styles—like solid, dashed, or dotted lines—vary.
*   **Spatial reasoning**: The model struggles with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying chess positions.
*   **Accuracy**: The model may generate incorrect descriptions or captions in certain scenarios.
*   **Image shape**: The model struggles with panoramic and fisheye images.
*   **Metadata and resizing**: The model doesn't process original file names or metadata, and images are resized before analysis, affecting their original dimensions.
*   **Counting**: The model may give approximate counts for objects in images.
*   **CAPTCHAS**: For safety reasons, our system blocks the submission of CAPTCHAs.

Calculating costs
-----------------

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens, just as text inputs are. How images are converted to text token inputs varies based on the model. You can find a vision pricing calculator in the FAQ section of the [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

### GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano, o4-mini

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens based on their dimensions. The token cost of an image is determined as follows:

*   Calculate the number of 32px x 32px patches that are needed to fully cover the image
*   If the number of patches exceeds 1536, we scale down the image so that it can be covered by no more than 1536 patches
*   The token cost is the number of patches, capped at a maximum of 1536 tokens
*   For `gpt-4.1-mini` we multiply image tokens by 1.62 to get total tokens, for `gpt-4.1-nano` we multiply image tokens by 2.46 to get total tokens, and for `o4-mini` we multiply image tokens by 1.72 to get total tokens, that are then billed at normal text token rates.

Note:

**Cost calculation examples**

*   A 1024 x 1024 image is **1024 tokens**
    *   Width is 1024, resulting in `(1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32` patches
    *   Height is 1024, resulting in `(1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32` patches
    *   Tokens calculated as `32 * 32 = 1024`, below the cap of 1536
*   A 1800 x 2400 image is **1452 tokens**
    *   Width is 1800, resulting in `(1800 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 57` patches
    *   Height is 2400, resulting in `(2400 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 75` patches
    *   We need `57 * 75 = 4275` patches to cover the full image. Since that exceeds 1536, we need to scale down the image while preserving the aspect ratio.
    *   We can calculate the shrink factor as `sqrt(token_budget × patch_size^2 / (width * height))`. In our example, the shrink factor is `sqrt(1536 * 32^2 / (1800 * 2400)) = 0.603`.
    *   Width is now 1086, resulting in `1086 / 32 = 33.94` patches
    *   Height is now 1448, resulting in `1448 / 32 = 45.25` patches
    *   We want to make sure the image fits in a whole number of patches. In this case we scale again by `33 / 33.94 = 0.97` to fit the width in 33 patches.
    *   The final width is then `1086 * (33 / 33.94) = 1056)` and the final height is `1448 * (33 / 33.94) = 1408`
    *   The image now requires `1056 / 32 = 33` patches to cover the width and `1408 / 32 = 44` patches to cover the height
    *   The total number of tokens is the `33 * 44 = 1452`, below the cap of 1536

### GPT 4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o-mini, CUA, and o-series (except o4-mini)

The token cost of an image is determined by two factors: size and detail.

Any image with `"detail": "low"` costs a set, base number of tokens. This amount varies by model (see charte below). To calculate the cost of an image with `"detail": "high"`, we do the following:

*   Scale to fit in a 2048px x 2048px square, maintaining original aspect ratio
*   Scale so that the image's shortest side is 768px long
*   Count the number of 512px squares in the image—each square costs a set amount of tokens (see chart below)
*   Add the base tokens to the total

|Model|Base tokens|Tile tokens|
|---|---|---|
|4o, 4.1, 4.5|85|170|
|4o-mini|2833|5667|
|o1, o1-pro, o3|75|150|
|computer-use-preview|65|129|

**Cost calculation examples (for gpt-4o)**

*   A 1024 x 1024 square image in `"detail": "high"` mode costs 765 tokens
    *   1024 is less than 2048, so there is no initial resize.
    *   The shortest side is 1024, so we scale the image down to 768 x 768.
    *   4 512px square tiles are needed to represent the image, so the final token cost is `170 * 4 + 85 = 765`.
*   A 2048 x 4096 image in `"detail": "high"` mode costs 1105 tokens
    *   We scale down the image to 1024 x 2048 to fit within the 2048 square.
    *   The shortest side is 1024, so we further scale down to 768 x 1536.
    *   6 512px tiles are needed, so the final token cost is `170 * 6 + 85 = 1105`.
*   A 4096 x 8192 image in `"detail": "low"` most costs 85 tokens
    *   Regardless of input size, low detail images are a fixed cost.

### GPT Image 1

For GPT Image 1, we calculate the cost of an image input the same way as described above, except that we scale down the image so that the shortest side is 512px instead of 768px. There is no detail level configuration for this model, so the price depends on the dimensions of the image.

The base cost is 65 image tokens, and each tile costs 129 image tokens.

To see pricing for image input tokens, refer to our [pricing page](/docs/pricing#latest-models).

* * *

We process images at the token level, so each image we process counts towards your tokens per minute (TPM) limit.

Structured Outputs
==================

Ensure responses adhere to a JSON schema.

Try it out
----------

Try it out in the [Playground](/playground) or generate a ready-to-use schema definition to experiment with structured outputs.

Generate

Introduction
------------

JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structured Outputs include:

1.  **Reliable type-safety:** No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
2.  **Explicit refusals:** Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
3.  **Simpler prompting:** No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting

In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/master/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) also make it easy to define object schemas using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const CalendarEvent = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  participants: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    { role: "system", content: "Extract the event information." },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday.",
    },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(CalendarEvent, "event"),
  },
});

const event = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday.",
        },
    ],
    text_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = response.output_parsed
```

### Supported models

Structured Outputs is available in our [latest large language models](/docs/models), starting with GPT-4o. Older models like `gpt-4-turbo` and earlier may use [JSON mode](#json-mode) instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via text.format
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

1.  When using [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling)
2.  When using a `json_schema` response format

Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via `response_format` are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

*   If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling
*   If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured `text.format`

The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Responses API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the [Function Calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#function-calling-with-structured-outputs) guide.

### Structured Outputs vs JSON mode

Structured Outputs is the evolution of [JSON mode](#json-mode). While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherance. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Responses API,Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with `response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...}` is only supported with the `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`, and `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model snapshots and later.

||Structured Outputs|JSON Mode|
|---|---|---|
|Outputs valid JSON|Yes|Yes|
|Adheres to schema|Yes (see supported schemas)|No|
|Compatible models|gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later|gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models|
|Enabling|text: { format: { type: "json_schema", "strict": true, "schema": ... } }|text: { format: { type: "json_object" } }|

Examples
--------

Chain of thought

### Chain of thought

You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),

Structured data extraction

### Structured data extraction

You can define structured fields to extract from unstructured input data, such as research papers.

Extracting data from research papers using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ResearchPaperExtraction = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  authors: z.array(z.string()),
  abstract: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: "..." },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(ResearchPaperExtraction, "research_paper_extraction"),
  },
});

const research_paper = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class ResearchPaperExtraction(BaseModel):
    title: str
    authors: list[str]
    abstract: str
    keywords: list[str]

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[

UI generation

### UI Generation

You can generate valid HTML by representing it as recursive data structures with constraints, like enums.

Generating HTML using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const UI = z.lazy(() =>
  z.object({
    type: z.enum(["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]),
    label: z.string(),
    children: z.array(UI),
    attributes: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        value: z.string(),
      })
    ),
  })
);

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a UI generator AI. Convert the user input into a UI.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Make a User Profile Form",
    },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(UI, "ui"),
  },
});

const ui = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List

from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class UIType(str, Enum):
    div = "div"
    button = "button"
    header = "header"
    section = "section"
    field = "field"

    name: str
    value: str

class UI(BaseModel):
    type: UIType
    label: str
    children: List["UI"]
    attributes: List[Attribute]

UI.model_rebuild()  # This is required to enable recursive types

class Response(BaseModel):
    ui: UI

response = client.responses.parse(

Moderation

### Moderation

You can classify inputs on multiple categories, which is a common way of doing moderation.

Moderation using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ContentCompliance = z.object({
  is_violating: z.boolean(),
  category: z.enum(["violence", "sexual", "self_harm"]).nullable(),
  explanation_if_violating: z.string().nullable(),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Determine if the user input violates specific guidelines and explain if they do."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "How do I prepare for a job interview?"
      }
    ],
    text: {
        format: zodTextFormat(ContentCompliance, "content_compliance"),

How to use Structured Outputs with text.format
----------------------------------------------

Step 1: Define your schema

First you must design the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the [examples](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#examples) at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See [here](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas) for more details.

#### Tips for your JSON Schema

To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

*   Name keys clearly and intuitively
*   Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
*   Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case

Step 2: Supply your schema in the API call

To use Structured Outputs, simply specify

```json
text: { format: { type: "json_schema", "strict": true, "schema": … } }
```

For example:

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    text={
        "format": {
            "type": "json_schema",
            "name": "math_response",
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "steps": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "explanation": {"type": "string"},
                                "output": {"type": "string"}
                            },
                            "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                            "additionalProperties": False
                        }
                    },
                    "final_answer": {"type": "string"}

              }
            },
            "final_answer": { "type": "string" }
          },

          "additionalProperties": false
        },
        "strict": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Note:** the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 3: Handle edge cases

In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

```javascript
try {
  const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [{
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      },
    ],
    max_output_tokens: 50,
    text: {
      format: {
        type: "json_schema",
        name: "math_response",
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            steps: {
              type: "array",
              items: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  explanation: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                  output: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                },
                required: ["explanation", "output"],
                additionalProperties: false,
              },
            },
            final_answer: {
              type: "string"
            },
          },
          required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
          additionalProperties: false,
        },
        strict: true,
      },
    }
  });

  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens") {
    // Handle the case where the model did not return a complete response
    throw new Error("Incomplete response");
  }

  const math_response = response.output[0].content[0];

  if (math_response.type === "refusal") {
    // handle refusal
    console.log(math_response.refusal);
  } else if (math_response.type === "output_text") {
    console.log(math_response.text);
  } else {
    throw new Error("No response content");
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle edge cases
  console.error(e);
}
```

```python
try:
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        input=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"},
        ],
        text={
            "format": {
                "type": "json_schema",
                "name": "math_response",
                "strict": True,
                "schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {

                            "type": "array",
                            "items": {
                                "type": "object",
                                "properties": {

                                    "output": {"type": "string"},
                                },
                                "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                                "additionalProperties": False,
                            },
                        },
                        "final_answer": {"type": "string"},
                    },
                    "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                    "additionalProperties": False,
                },
                "strict": True,
            },
        },
    )
except Exception as e:
    # handle errors like finish_reason, refusal, content_filter, etc.
    pass
```

### Refusals with Structured Outputs

When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in `response_format`, the API response will include a new field called `refusal` to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the `refusal` property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.

```python
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

# If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal):
    print(math_reasoning.refusal)
else:
    print(math_reasoning.parsed)
```

```javascript
const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

// If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal) {
  console.log(math_reasoning.refusal);
} else {
  console.log(math_reasoning.parsed);
}
```

The API response from a refusal will look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "resp_1234567890",
  "object": "response",
  "created_at": 1721596428,
  "status": "completed",
  "error": null,
  "incomplete_details": null,
  "input": [],
  "instructions": null,
  "max_output_tokens": null,
  "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  "output": [{
    "id": "msg_1234567890",
    "type": "message",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "refusal",
        "refusal": "I'm sorry, I cannot assist with that request."
      }
    ]
  }],
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 81,
    "output_tokens": 11,
    "total_tokens": 92,
    "output_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 0,
    }
  },
}
```

### Tips and best practices

#### Handling user-generated input

If your application is using user-generated input, make sure your prompt includes instructions on how to handle situations where the input cannot result in a valid response.

The model will always try to adhere to the provided schema, which can result in hallucinations if the input is completely unrelated to the schema.

You could include language in your prompt to specify that you want to return empty parameters, or a specific sentence, if the model detects that the input is incompatible with the task.

#### Handling mistakes

Structured Outputs can still contain mistakes. If you see mistakes, try adjusting your instructions, providing examples in the system instructions, or splitting tasks into simpler subtasks. Refer to the [prompt engineering guide](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more guidance on how to tweak your inputs.

#### Avoid JSON schema divergence

To prevent your JSON Schema and corresponding types in your programming language from diverging, we strongly recommend using the native Pydantic/zod sdk support.

If you prefer to specify the JSON schema directly, you could add CI rules that flag when either the JSON schema or underlying data objects are edited, or add a CI step that auto-generates the JSON Schema from type definitions (or vice-versa).

Streaming
---------

You can use streaming to process model responses or function call arguments as they are being generated, and parse them as structured data.

That way, you don't have to wait for the entire response to complete before handling it. This is particularly useful if you would like to display JSON fields one by one, or handle function call arguments as soon as they are available.

We recommend relying on the SDKs to handle streaming with Structured Outputs.

```python
from typing import List

from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EntitiesModel(BaseModel):
    attributes: List[str]
    colors: List[str]
    animals: List[str]

client = OpenAI()

with client.responses.stream(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract entities from the input text"},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog with piercing blue eyes",
        },
    ],
    text_format=EntitiesModel,
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "response.refusal.delta":
            print(event.delta, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.output_text.delta":
            print(event.delta, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.error":
            print(event.error, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.completed":
            print("Completed")
            # print(event.response.output)

    final_response = stream.get_final_response()
    print(final_response)
```

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const EntitiesSchema = z.object({
  attributes: z.array(z.string()),
  colors: z.array(z.string()),
  animals: z.array(z.string()),
});

const openai = new OpenAI();
const stream = openai.responses
  .stream({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
      { role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in Paris today?" },
    ],
    text: {
      format: zodTextFormat(EntitiesSchema, "entities"),
    },
  })
  .on("response.refusal.delta", (event) => {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta);
  })
  .on("response.output_text.delta", (event) => {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta);
  })
  .on("response.output_text.done", () => {
    process.stdout.write("\n");
  })
  .on("response.error", (event) => {
    console.error(event.error);
  });

const result = await stream.finalResponse();

console.log(result);
```

Supported schemas
-----------------

Structured Outputs supports a subset of the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/docs) language.

#### Supported types

The following types are supported for Structured Outputs:

*   String
*   Number
*   Boolean
*   Integer
*   Object
*   Array
*   Enum
*   anyOf

#### Supported properties

In addition to specifying the type of a property, you can specify a selection of additional constraints:

**Supported `string` properties:**

*   `pattern` — A regular expression that the string must match.
*   `format` — Predefined formats for strings. Currently supported:
    *   `date-time`
    *   `time`
    *   `date`
    *   `duration`
    *   `email`
    *   `hostname`
    *   `ipv4`
    *   `ipv6`
    *   `uuid`

**Supported `number` properties:**

*   `multipleOf` — The number must be a multiple of this value.
*   `maximum` — The number must be less than or equal to this value.
*   `exclusiveMaximum` — The number must be less than this value.
*   `minimum` — The number must be greater than or equal to this value.
*   `exclusiveMinimum` — The number must be greater than this value.

**Supported `array` properties:**

*   `minItems` — The array must have at least this many items.
*   `maxItems` — The array must have at most this many items.

Here are some examples on how you can use these type restrictions:

String Restrictions

```json
{
    "name": "user_data",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "name": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The name of the user"
            },
            "username": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The username of the user. Must start with @",
                "pattern": "^@[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"
            },
            "email": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The email of the user",
                "format": "email"
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "name", "username", "email"
        ]
    }
}
```

Number Restrictions

```json
{
    "name": "weather_data",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            },
            "value": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "The actual temperature value in the location",
                "minimum": -130,
                "maximum": 130
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit", "value"
        ]
    }
}
```

Note these constraints are [not yet supported for fine-tuned models](#some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported).

#### Root objects must not be `anyOf` and must be an object

Note that the root level object of a schema must be an object, and not use `anyOf`. A pattern that appears in Zod (as one example) is using a discriminated union, which produces an `anyOf` at the top level. So code such as the following won't work:

```javascript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodResponseFormat } from 'openai/helpers/zod';

const BaseResponseSchema = z.object({/* ... */});
const UnsuccessfulResponseSchema = z.object({/* ... */});

const finalSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('status', [
BaseResponseSchema,
UnsuccessfulResponseSchema,
]);

// Invalid JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
const json = zodResponseFormat(finalSchema, 'final_schema');
```

#### All fields must be `required`

To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as `required`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": ["location", "unit"]
    }
}
```

Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with `null`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size

A schema may have up to 100 object properties total, with up to 5 levels of nesting.

#### Limitations on total string size

In a schema, total string length of all property names, definition names, enum values, and const values cannot exceed 15,000 characters.

#### Limitations on enum size

A schema may have up to 500 enum values across all enum properties.

For a single enum property with string values, the total string length of all enum values cannot exceed 7,500 characters when there are more than 250 enum values.

#### `additionalProperties: false` must always be set in objects

`additionalProperties` controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.

Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set `additionalProperties: false` to opt into Structured Outputs.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Key ordering

When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.

#### Some type-specific keywords are not yet supported

*   **Composition:** `allOf`, `not`, `dependentRequired`, `dependentSchemas`, `if`, `then`, `else`

For fine-tuned models, we additionally do not support the following:

*   **For strings:** `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `format`
*   **For numbers:** `minimum`, `maximum`, `multipleOf`
*   **For objects:** `patternProperties`
*   **For arrays:** `minItems`, `maxItems`

If you turn on Structured Outputs by supplying `strict: true` and call the API with an unsupported JSON Schema, you will receive an error.

#### For `anyOf`, the nested schemas must each be a valid JSON Schema per this subset

Here's an example supported anyOf schema:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "item": {
            "anyOf": [
                {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The user object to insert into the database",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the user"
                        },
                        "age": {
                            "type": "number",
                            "description": "The age of the user"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": [
                        "name",
                        "age"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The address object to insert into the database",
                    "properties": {
                        "number": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The number of the address. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be 123"
                        },
                        "street": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The street name. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be main st"
                        },
                        "city": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The city of the address"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": [
                        "number",
                        "street",
                        "city"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "item"
    ]
}
```

#### Definitions are supported

You can use definitions to define subschemas which are referenced throughout your schema. The following is a simple example.

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "steps": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "$ref": "#/$defs/step"
            }
        },
        "final_answer": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "step": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "explanation": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "output": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "explanation",
                "output"
            ],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "steps",
        "final_answer"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

#### Recursive schemas are supported

Sample recursive schema using `#` to indicate root recursion.

```json
{
    "name": "ui",
    "description": "Dynamically generated UI",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "type": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The type of the UI component",
                "enum": ["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]
            },
            "label": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The label of the UI component, used for buttons or form fields"
            },
            "children": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "Nested UI components",
                "items": {
                    "$ref": "#"
                }
            },
            "attributes": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "Arbitrary attributes for the UI component, suitable for any element",
                "items": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the attribute, for example onClick or className"
                        },
                        "value": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The value of the attribute"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": ["name", "value"]
                }
            }
        },
        "required": ["type", "label", "children", "attributes"],
        "additionalProperties": false
    }
}
```

Sample recursive schema using explicit recursion:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "linked_list": {
            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "linked_list_node": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "value": {
                    "type": "number"
                },
                "next": {
                    "anyOf": [
                        {
                            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "null"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "additionalProperties": false,
            "required": [
                "next",
                "value"
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "linked_list"
    ]
}
```

JSON mode
---------

JSON mode is a more basic version of the Structured Outputs feature. While JSON mode ensures that model output is valid JSON, Structured Outputs reliably matches the model's output to the schema you specify. We recommend you use Structured Outputs if it is supported for your use case.

When JSON mode is turned on, the model's output is ensured to be valid JSON, except for in some edge cases that you should detect and handle appropriately.

To turn on JSON mode with the Responses API you can set the `text.format` to `{ "type": "json_object" }`. If you are using function calling, JSON mode is always turned on.

Important notes:

*   When using JSON mode, you must always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
*   JSON mode will not guarantee the output matches any specific schema, only that it is valid and parses without errors. You should use Structured Outputs to ensure it matches your schema, or if that is not possible, you should use a validation library and potentially retries to ensure that the output matches your desired schema.
*   Your application must detect and handle the edge cases that can result in the model output not being a complete JSON object (see below)

Handling edge cases

```javascript
const we_did_not_specify_stop_tokens = true;

try {
  const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
    input: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON.",
      },
      { role: "user", content: "Who won the world series in 2020? Please respond in the format {winner: ...}" },
    ],
    text: { format: { type: "json_object" } },
  });

  // Check if the conversation was too long for the context window, resulting in incomplete JSON 
  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens") {
    // your code should handle this error case
  }

  // Check if the OpenAI safety system refused the request and generated a refusal instead
  if (response.output[0].content[0].type === "refusal") {
    // your code should handle this error case
    // In this case, the .content field will contain the explanation (if any) that the model generated for why it is refusing
    console.log(response.output[0].content[0].refusal)
  }

  // Check if the model's output included restricted content, so the generation of JSON was halted and may be partial
  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "content_filter") {
    // your code should handle this error case
  }

  if (response.status === "completed") {
    // In this case the model has either successfully finished generating the JSON object according to your schema, or the model generated one of the tokens you provided as a "stop token"

    if (we_did_not_specify_stop_tokens) {
      // If you didn't specify any stop tokens, then the generation is complete and the content key will contain the serialized JSON object
      // This will parse successfully and should now contain  {"winner": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}
      console.log(JSON.parse(response.output_text))
    } else {
      // Check if the response.output_text ends with one of your stop tokens and handle appropriately
    }
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Your code should handle errors here, for example a network error calling the API
  console.error(e)
}
```

Function calling
================

Enable models to fetch data and take actions.

**Function calling** provides a powerful and flexible way for OpenAI models to interface with your code or external services. This guide will explain how to connect the models to your own custom code to fetch data or take action.

Get weather

Function calling example with get\_weather function

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "location"
        ],
        "additionalProperties": False
    }
}]

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"}],
    tools=tools
)

print(response.output)
```

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "location"
        ],
        "additionalProperties": false
    }
}];

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [{ role: "user", content: "What is the weather like in Paris today?" }],
    tools,
});

console.log(response.output);
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
-d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "input": "What is the weather like in Paris today?",
    "tools": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "location"
                ],
                "additionalProperties": false
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

Output

```json
[{
    "type": "function_call",
    "id": "fc_12345xyz",
    "call_id": "call_12345xyz",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Paris, France\"}"
}]
```

Send email

Function calling example with send\_email function

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "send_email",
    "description": "Send an email to a given recipient with a subject and message.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "to": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The recipient email address."

Experiment with function calling and [generate function schemas](/docs/guides/prompt-generation) in the [Playground](/playground)!

Overview
--------

You can give the model access to your own custom code through **function calling**. Based on the system prompt and messages, the model may decide to call these functions — **instead of (or in addition to) generating text or audio**.

You'll then execute the function code, send back the results, and the model will incorporate them into its final response.

![Function Calling Diagram Steps](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/function-calling-diagram-steps.png)

Function calling has two primary use cases:

|||
|---|---|
|Fetching Data|Retrieve up-to-date information to incorporate into the model's response (RAG). Useful for searching knowledge bases and retrieving specific data from APIs (e.g. current weather data).|
|Taking Action|Perform actions like submitting a form, calling APIs, modifying application state (UI/frontend or backend), or taking agentic workflow actions (like handing off the conversation).|

### Sample function

Let's look at the steps to allow a model to use a real `get_weather` function defined below:

Sample get\_weather function implemented in your codebase

```python
import requests

def get_weather(latitude, longitude):
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&current=temperature_2m,wind_speed_10m&hourly=temperature_2m,relative_humidity_2m,wind_speed_10m")
    data = response.json()
    return data['current']['temperature_2m']
```

```javascript
async function getWeather(latitude, longitude) {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=temperature_2m,wind_speed_10m&hourly=temperature_2m,relative_humidity_2m,wind_speed_10m`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.current.temperature_2m;
}
```

Unlike the diagram earlier, this function expects precise `latitude` and `longitude` instead of a general `location` parameter. (However, our models can automatically determine the coordinates for many locations!)

### Function calling steps

*   **Call model with [functions defined](#defining-functions)** – along with your system and user messages.
    

Step 1: Call model with get\_weather tool defined

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json

client = OpenAI()

tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get current temperature for provided coordinates in celsius.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "latitude": {"type": "number"},
            "longitude": {"type": "number"}
        },
        "required": ["latitude", "longitude"],
        "additionalProperties": False
    },
    "strict": True
}]

input_messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Paris today?"}]

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=input_messages,
    tools=tools,
)
```

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const tools = [{
    type: "function",
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current temperature for provided coordinates in celsius.",
    parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            latitude: { type: "number" },
            longitude: { type: "number" }
        },
        required: ["latitude", "longitude"],
        additionalProperties: false
    },
    strict: true
}];

const input = [
    {
        role: "user",
        content: "What's the weather like in Paris today?"
    }
];

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input,
    tools,
});
```

*   **Model decides to call function(s)** – model returns the **name** and **input arguments**.
    

response.output

```json
[{
    "type": "function_call",
    "id": "fc_12345xyz",
    "call_id": "call_12345xyz",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": "{\"latitude\":48.8566,\"longitude\":2.3522}"
}]
```

*   **Execute function code** – parse the model's response and [handle function calls](#handling-function-calls).
    

Step 3: Execute get\_weather function

```python
tool_call = response.output[0]
args = json.loads(tool_call.arguments)

result = get_weather(args["latitude"], args["longitude"])
```

```javascript
const toolCall = response.output[0];
const args = JSON.parse(toolCall.arguments);

const result = await getWeather(args.latitude, args.longitude);
```

*   **Supply model with results** – so it can incorporate them into its final response.
    

Step 4: Supply result and call model again

```python
input_messages.append(tool_call)  # append model's function call message
input_messages.append({                               # append result message
    "type": "function_call_output",
    "call_id": tool_call.call_id,
    "output": str(result)
})

response_2 = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=input_messages,
    tools=tools,
)
print(response_2.output_text)
```

```javascript
input.push(toolCall); // append model's function call message
input.push({                               // append result message
    type: "function_call_output",
    call_id: toolCall.call_id,
    output: result.toString()
});

const response2 = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input,
    tools,
    store: true,
});

console.log(response2.output_text)
```

*   **Model responds** – incorporating the result in its output.
    

response\_2.output\_text

```json
"The current temperature in Paris is 14°C (57.2°F)."
```

Defining functions
------------------

Functions can be set in the `tools` parameter of each API request.

A function is defined by its schema, which informs the model what it does and what input arguments it expects. It comprises the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|type|This should always be function|
|name|The function's name (e.g. get_weather)|
|description|Details on when and how to use the function|
|parameters|JSON schema defining the function's input arguments|
|strict|Whether to enforce strict mode for the function call|

Take a look at this example or generate your own below (or in our [Playground](/playground)).

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Retrieves current weather for the given location.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
      },
      "units": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "celsius",
          "fahrenheit"
        ],
        "description": "Units the temperature will be returned in."
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "location",
      "units"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
  },
  "strict": true
}
```

Because the `parameters` are defined by a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/), you can leverage many of its rich features like property types, enums, descriptions, nested objects, and, recursive objects.

### Best practices for defining functions

1.  **Write clear and detailed function names, parameter descriptions, and instructions.**
    
    *   **Explicitly describe the purpose of the function and each parameter** (and its format), and what the output represents.
    *   **Use the system prompt to describe when (and when not) to use each function.** Generally, tell the model _exactly_ what to do.
    *   **Include examples and edge cases**, especially to rectify any recurring failures. (**Note:** Adding examples may hurt performance for [reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning).)
2.  **Apply software engineering best practices.**
    
    *   **Make the functions obvious and intuitive**. ([principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment))
    *   **Use enums** and object structure to make invalid states unrepresentable. (e.g. `toggle_light(on: bool, off: bool)` allows for invalid calls)
    *   **Pass the intern test.** Can an intern/human correctly use the function given nothing but what you gave the model? (If not, what questions do they ask you? Add the answers to the prompt.)
3.  **Offload the burden from the model and use code where possible.**
    
    *   **Don't make the model fill arguments you already know.** For example, if you already have an `order_id` based on a previous menu, don't have an `order_id` param – instead, have no params `submit_refund()` and pass the `order_id` with code.
    *   **Combine functions that are always called in sequence.** For example, if you always call `mark_location()` after `query_location()`, just move the marking logic into the query function call.
4.  **Keep the number of functions small for higher accuracy.**
    
    *   **Evaluate your performance** with different numbers of functions.
    *   **Aim for fewer than 20 functions** at any one time, though this is just a soft suggestion.
5.  **Leverage OpenAI resources.**
    
    *   **Generate and iterate on function schemas** in the [Playground](/playground).
    *   **Consider [fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) to increase function calling accuracy** for large numbers of functions or difficult tasks. ([cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/fine_tuning_for_function_calling))

### Token Usage

Under the hood, functions are injected into the system message in a syntax the model has been trained on. This means functions count against the model's context limit and are billed as input tokens. If you run into token limits, we suggest limiting the number of functions or the length of the descriptions you provide for function parameters.

It is also possible to use [fine-tuning](/docs/guides/fine-tuning#fine-tuning-examples) to reduce the number of tokens used if you have many functions defined in your tools specification.

Handling function calls
-----------------------

When the model calls a function, you must execute it and return the result. Since model responses can include zero, one, or multiple calls, it is best practice to assume there are several.

The response `output` array contains an entry with the `type` having a value of `function_call`. Each entry with a `call_id` (used later to submit the function result), `name`, and JSON-encoded `arguments`.

Sample response with multiple function calls

```json
[
    {
        "id": "fc_12345xyz",
        "call_id": "call_12345xyz",
        "type": "function_call",
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Paris, France\"}"
    },
    {
        "id": "fc_67890abc",
        "call_id": "call_67890abc",
        "type": "function_call",
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Bogotá, Colombia\"}"
    },
    {
        "id": "fc_99999def",
        "call_id": "call_99999def",
        "type": "function_call",
        "name": "send_email",
        "arguments": "{\"to\":\"bob@email.com\",\"body\":\"Hi bob\"}"
    }
]
```

Execute function calls and append results

```python
for tool_call in response.output:
    if tool_call.type != "function_call":
        continue

    name = tool_call.name
    args = json.loads(tool_call.arguments)

    result = call_function(name, args)
    input_messages.append({
        "type": "function_call_output",
        "call_id": tool_call.call_id,
        "output": str(result)
    })
```

```javascript
for (const toolCall of response.output) {
    if (toolCall.type !== "function_call") {
        continue;
    }

    const name = toolCall.name;
    const args = JSON.parse(toolCall.arguments);

    const result = callFunction(name, args);
    input.push({
        type: "function_call_output",
        call_id: toolCall.call_id,
        output: result.toString()
    });
}
```

In the example above, we have a hypothetical `call_function` to route each call. Here’s a possible implementation:

Execute function calls and append results

```python
def call_function(name, args):
    if name == "get_weather":
        return get_weather(**args)
    if name == "send_email":
        return send_email(**args)
```

```javascript
const callFunction = async (name, args) => {
    if (name === "get_weather") {
        return getWeather(args.latitude, args.longitude);
    }
    if (name === "send_email") {
        return sendEmail(args.to, args.body);
    }
};
```

### Formatting results

A result must be a string, but the format is up to you (JSON, error codes, plain text, etc.). The model will interpret that string as needed.

If your function has no return value (e.g. `send_email`), simply return a string to indicate success or failure. (e.g. `"success"`)

### Incorporating results into response

After appending the results to your `input`, you can send them back to the model to get a final response.

Send results back to model

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=input_messages,
    tools=tools,
)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input,
    tools,
});
```

Final response

```json
"It's about 15°C in Paris, 18°C in Bogotá, and I've sent that email to Bob."
```

Additional configurations
-------------------------

### Tool choice

By default the model will determine when and how many tools to use. You can force specific behavior with the `tool_choice` parameter.

1.  **Auto:** (_Default_) Call zero, one, or multiple functions. `tool_choice: "auto"`
2.  **Required:** Call one or more functions. `tool_choice: "required"`

3.  **Forced Function:** Call exactly one specific function. `tool_choice: {"type": "function", "name": "get_weather"}`

![Function Calling Diagram Steps](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/function-calling-diagram-tool-choice.png)

You can also set `tool_choice` to `"none"` to imitate the behavior of passing no functions.

### Parallel function calling

The model may choose to call multiple functions in a single turn. You can prevent this by setting `parallel_tool_calls` to `false`, which ensures exactly zero or one tool is called.

**Note:** Currently, if you are using a fine tuned model and the model calls multiple functions in one turn then [strict mode](#strict-mode) will be disabled for those calls.

**Note for `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14`:** This snapshot of `gpt-4.1-nano` can sometimes include multiple tools calls for the same tool if parallel tool calls are enabled. It is recommended to disable this feature when using this nano snapshot.

### Strict mode

Setting `strict` to `true` will ensure function calls reliably adhere to the function schema, instead of being best effort. We recommend always enabling strict mode.

Under the hood, strict mode works by leveraging our [structured outputs](/docs/guides/structured-outputs) feature and therefore introduces a couple requirements:

1.  `additionalProperties` must be set to `false` for each object in the `parameters`.
2.  All fields in `properties` must be marked as `required`.

You can denote optional fields by adding `null` as a `type` option (see example below).

Strict mode enabled

```json
{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Retrieves current weather for the given location.",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
            },
            "units": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                "description": "Units the temperature will be returned in."
            }
        },
        "required": ["location", "units"],
        "additionalProperties": false
    }
}
```

Strict mode disabled

```json
{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Retrieves current weather for the given location.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
            },
            "units": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                "description": "Units the temperature will be returned in."
            }
        },
        "required": ["location"],
    }
}
```

All schemas generated in the [playground](/playground) have strict mode enabled.

While we recommend you enable strict mode, it has a few limitations:

1.  Some features of JSON schema are not supported. (See [supported schemas](/docs/guides/structured-outputs?context=with_parse#supported-schemas).)

Specifically for fine tuned models:

1.  Schemas undergo additional processing on the first request (and are then cached). If your schemas vary from request to request, this may result in higher latencies.
2.  Schemas are cached for performance, and are not eligible for [zero data retention](/docs/models#how-we-use-your-data).

Streaming
---------

Streaming can be used to surface progress by showing which function is called as the model fills its arguments, and even displaying the arguments in real time.

Streaming function calls is very similar to streaming regular responses: you set `stream` to `true` and get different `event` objects.

Streaming function calls

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "location"
        ],
        "additionalProperties": False
    }
}]

stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Paris today?"}],
    tools=tools,
    stream=True
)

for event in stream:
    print(event)
```

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const tools = [{
    type: "function",
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current temperature for provided coordinates in celsius.",
    parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            latitude: { type: "number" },
            longitude: { type: "number" }
        },
        required: ["latitude", "longitude"],
        additionalProperties: false
    },
    strict: true
}];

const stream = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [{ role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in Paris today?" }],
    tools,
    stream: true,
    store: true,
});

for await (const event of stream) {
    console.log(event)
}
```

Output events

```json
{"type":"response.output_item.added","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","output_index":0,"item":{"type":"function_call","id":"fc_1234xyz","call_id":"call_1234xyz","name":"get_weather","arguments":""}}
{"type":"response.function_call_arguments.delta","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","item_id":"fc_1234xyz","output_index":0,"delta":"{\""}
{"type":"response.function_call_arguments.delta","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","item_id":"fc_1234xyz","output_index":0,"delta":"location"}
{"type":"response.function_call_arguments.delta","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","item_id":"fc_1234xyz","output_index":0,"delta":"\":\""}
{"type":"response.function_call_arguments.delta","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","item_id":"fc_1234xyz","output_index":0,"delta":"Paris"}
{"type":"response.function_call_arguments.delta","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","item_id":"fc_1234xyz","output_index":0,"delta":","}
{"type":"response.function_call_arguments.delta","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","item_id":"fc_1234xyz","output_index":0,"delta":" France"}
{"type":"response.function_call_arguments.delta","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","item_id":"fc_1234xyz","output_index":0,"delta":"\"}"}
{"type":"response.function_call_arguments.done","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","item_id":"fc_1234xyz","output_index":0,"arguments":"{\"location\":\"Paris, France\"}"}
{"type":"response.output_item.done","response_id":"resp_1234xyz","output_index":0,"item":{"type":"function_call","id":"fc_1234xyz","call_id":"call_2345abc","name":"get_weather","arguments":"{\"location\":\"Paris, France\"}"}}
```

Instead of aggregating chunks into a single `content` string, however, you're aggregating chunks into an encoded `arguments` JSON object.

When the model calls one or more functions an event of type `response.output_item.added` will be emitted for each function call that contains the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|response_id|The id of the response that the function call belongs to|
|output_index|The index of the output item in the response. This respresents the individual function calls in the response.|
|item|The in-progress function call item that includes a name, arguments and id field|

Afterwards you will receive a series of events of type `response.function_call_arguments.delta` which will contain the `delta` of the `arguments` field. These events contain the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|response_id|The id of the response that the function call belongs to|
|item_id|The id of the function call item that the delta belongs to|
|output_index|The index of the output item in the response. This respresents the individual function calls in the response.|
|delta|The delta of the arguments field.|

Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to aggregate the `delta`s into a final `tool_call` object.

Accumulating tool\_call deltas

```python
final_tool_calls = {}

for event in stream:
    if event.type === 'response.output_item.added':
        final_tool_calls[event.output_index] = event.item;
    elif event.type === 'response.function_call_arguments.delta':
        index = event.output_index

        if final_tool_calls[index]:
            final_tool_calls[index].arguments += event.delta
```

```javascript
const finalToolCalls = {};

for await (const event of stream) {
    if (event.type === 'response.output_item.added') {
        finalToolCalls[event.output_index] = event.item;
    } else if (event.type === 'response.function_call_arguments.delta') {
        const index = event.output_index;

        if (finalToolCalls[index]) {
            finalToolCalls[index].arguments += event.delta;
        }
    }
}
```

Accumulated final\_tool\_calls\[0\]

```json
{
    "type": "function_call",
    "id": "fc_1234xyz",
    "call_id": "call_2345abc",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Paris, France\"}"
}
```

When the model has finished calling the functions an event of type `response.function_call_arguments.done` will be emitted. This event contains the entire function call including the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|response_id|The id of the response that the function call belongs to|
|output_index|The index of the output item in the response. This respresents the individual function calls in the response.|
|item|The function call item that includes a name, arguments and id field.|

Conversation state
==================

Learn how to manage conversation state during a model interaction.

OpenAI provides a few ways to manage conversation state, which is important for preserving information across multiple messages or turns in a conversation.

Manually manage conversation state
----------------------------------

While each text generation request is independent and stateless (unless you're using [the Assistants API](/docs/assistants/overview)), you can still implement **multi-turn conversations** by providing additional messages as parameters to your text generation request. Consider a knock-knock joke:

Manually construct a past conversation

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: [
        { role: "user", content: "knock knock." },
        { role: "assistant", content: "Who's there?" },
        { role: "user", content: "Orange." },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "knock knock."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who's there?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Orange."},
    ],
)

print(response.output_text)
```

By using alternating `user` and `assistant` messages, you capture the previous state of a conversation in one request to the model.

To manually share context across generated responses, include the model's previous response output as input, and append that input to your next request.

In the following example, we ask the model to tell a joke, followed by a request for another joke. Appending previous responses to new requests in this way helps ensure conversations feel natural and retain the context of previous interactions.

Manually manage conversation state with the Responses API.

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

let history = [
    {
        role: "user",
        content: "tell me a joke",
    },
];

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: history,
    store: true,
});

console.log(response.output_text);

// Add the response to the history
history = [
    ...history,
    ...response.output.map((el) => {
        // TODO: Remove this step
        delete el.id;
        return el;
    }),
];

history.push({
    role: "user",
    content: "tell me another",
});

const secondResponse = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: history,
    store: true,
});

console.log(secondResponse.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

history = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "tell me a joke"
    }
]

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input=history,
    store=False
)

print(response.output_text)

# Add the response to the conversation
history += [{"role": el.role, "content": el.content} for el in response.output]

history.append({ "role": "user", "content": "tell me another" })

second_response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input=history,
    store=False
)

print(second_response.output_text)
```

OpenAI APIs for conversation state
----------------------------------

Our APIs make it easier to manage conversation state automatically, so you don't have to do pass inputs manually with each turn of a conversation.

Share context across generated responses with the `previous_response_id` parameter. This parameter lets you chain responses and create a threaded conversation.

In the following example, we ask the model to tell a joke. Separately, we ask the model to explain why it's funny, and the model has all necessary context to deliver a good response.

Manually manage conversation state with the Responses API.

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "tell me a joke",
    store: true,
});

console.log(response.output_text);

const secondResponse = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    previous_response_id: response.id,
    input: [{"role": "user", "content": "explain why this is funny."}],
    store: true,
});

console.log(secondResponse.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="tell me a joke",
)
print(response.output_text)

second_response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    previous_response_id=response.id,
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": "explain why this is funny."}],
)
print(second_response.output_text)
```

Data retention for model responses

Response objects are saved for 30 days by default. They can be viewed in the dashboard [logs](/logs?api=responses) page or [retrieved](/docs/api-reference/responses/get) via the API. You can disable this behavior by setting `store` to `false` when creating a Response.

OpenAI does not use data sent via API to train our models without your explicit consent—[learn more](/docs/guides/your-data).

Even when using `previous_response_id`, all previous input tokens for responses in the chain are billed as input tokens in the API.

Managing the context window
---------------------------

Understanding context windows will help you successfully create threaded conversations and manage state across model interactions.

The **context window** is the maximum number of tokens that can be used in a single request. This max tokens number includes input, output, and reasoning tokens. To learn your model's context window, see [model details](/docs/models).

### Managing context for text generation

As your inputs become more complex, or you include more turns in a conversation, you'll need to consider both **output token** and **context window** limits. Model inputs and outputs are metered in [**tokens**](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them), which are parsed from inputs to analyze their content and intent and assembled to render logical outputs. Models have limits on token usage during the lifecycle of a text generation request.

*   **Output tokens** are the tokens generated by a model in response to a prompt. Each model has different [limits for output tokens](/docs/models). For example, `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` can generate a maximum of 16,384 output tokens.
*   A **context window** describes the total tokens that can be used for both input and output tokens (and for some models, [reasoning tokens](/docs/guides/reasoning)). Compare the [context window limits](/docs/models) of our models. For example, `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` has a total context window of 128k tokens.

If you create a very large prompt—often by including extra context, data, or examples for the model—you run the risk of exceeding the allocated context window for a model, which might result in truncated outputs.

Use the [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer), built with the [tiktoken library](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken), to see how many tokens are in a particular string of text.

For example, when making an API request to the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses) with a reasoning enabled model, like the [o1 model](/docs/guides/reasoning), the following token counts will apply toward the context window total:

*   Input tokens (inputs you include in the `input` array for the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses))
*   Output tokens (tokens generated in response to your prompt)
*   Reasoning tokens (used by the model to plan a response)

Tokens generated in excess of the context window limit may be truncated in API responses.

You can estimate the number of tokens your messages will use with the [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer).

Reasoning models
================

Explore advanced reasoning and problem-solving models.

**Reasoning models** like o3 and o4-mini are LLMs trained with reinforcement learning to perform reasoning. Reasoning models [think before they answer](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/), producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving, coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step planning for agentic workflows. They're also the best models for [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), our lightweight coding agent.

As with our GPT series, we provide smaller, faster models (`o4-mini` and `o3-mini`) that are less expensive per token. The larger models (`o3` and `o1`) are slower and more expensive but often generate better responses for complex tasks and broad domains.

To ensure safe deployment of our latest reasoning models [`o3`](/docs/models/o3) and [`o4-mini`](/docs/models/o4-mini), some developers may need to complete [organization verification](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification) before accessing these models. Get started with verification on the [platform settings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general).

Get started with reasoning
--------------------------

Reasoning models can be used through the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses/create) as seen here.

Using a reasoning model in the Responses API

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with 
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
`;

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "o4-mini",
    reasoning: { effort: "medium" },
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with 
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    reasoning={"effort": "medium"},
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": prompt
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o4-mini",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"},
    "input": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with format \"[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]\" and prints the transpose in the same format."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

In the example above, the `reasoning.effort` parameter guides the model on how many reasoning tokens to generate before creating a response to the prompt.

Specify `low`, `medium`, or `high` for this parameter, where `low` favors speed and economical token usage, and `high` favors more complete reasoning. The default value is `medium`, which is a balance between speed and reasoning accuracy.

How reasoning works
-------------------

Reasoning models introduce **reasoning tokens** in addition to input and output tokens. The models use these reasoning tokens to "think," breaking down the prompt and considering multiple approaches to generating a response. After generating reasoning tokens, the model produces an answer as visible completion tokens and discards the reasoning tokens from its context.

Here is an example of a multi-step conversation between a user and an assistant. Input and output tokens from each step are carried over, while reasoning tokens are discarded.

![Reasoning tokens aren't retained in context](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/context-window.png)

While reasoning tokens are not visible via the API, they still occupy space in the model's context window and are billed as [output tokens](https://openai.com/api/pricing).

### Managing the context window

It's important to ensure there's enough space in the context window for reasoning tokens when creating responses. Depending on the problem's complexity, the models may generate anywhere from a few hundred to tens of thousands of reasoning tokens. The exact number of reasoning tokens used is visible in the [usage object of the response object](/docs/api-reference/responses/object), under `output_tokens_details`:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 75,
    "input_tokens_details": {
      "cached_tokens": 0
    },
    "output_tokens": 1186,
    "output_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 1024
    },
    "total_tokens": 1261
  }
}
```

Context window lengths are found on the [model reference page](/docs/models), and will differ across model snapshots.

### Controlling costs

If you're managing context manually across model turns, you can discard older reasoning items _unless_ you're responding to a function call, in which case you must include all reasoning items between the function call and the last user message.

To manage costs with reasoning models, you can limit the total number of tokens the model generates (including both reasoning and final output tokens) by using the [`max_output_tokens`](/docs/api-reference/responses/create#responses-create-max_output_tokens) parameter.

### Allocating space for reasoning

If the generated tokens reach the context window limit or the `max_output_tokens` value you've set, you'll receive a response with a `status` of `incomplete` and `incomplete_details` with `reason` set to `max_output_tokens`. This might occur before any visible output tokens are produced, meaning you could incur costs for input and reasoning tokens without receiving a visible response.

To prevent this, ensure there's sufficient space in the context window or adjust the `max_output_tokens` value to a higher number. OpenAI recommends reserving at least 25,000 tokens for reasoning and outputs when you start experimenting with these models. As you become familiar with the number of reasoning tokens your prompts require, you can adjust this buffer accordingly.

Handling incomplete responses

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with 
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
`;

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "o4-mini",
    reasoning: { effort: "medium" },
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
    max_output_tokens: 300,
});

if (
    response.status === "incomplete" &&
    response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens"
) {
    console.log("Ran out of tokens");
    if (response.output_text?.length > 0) {
        console.log("Partial output:", response.output_text);
    } else {
        console.log("Ran out of tokens during reasoning");
    }
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
Write a bash script that takes a matrix represented as a string with 
format '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]' and prints the transpose in the same format.
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    reasoning={"effort": "medium"},
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": prompt
        }
    ],
    max_output_tokens=300,
)

if response.status == "incomplete" and response.incomplete_details.reason == "max_output_tokens":
    print("Ran out of tokens")
    if response.output_text:
        print("Partial output:", response.output_text)
    else: 
        print("Ran out of tokens during reasoning")
```

### Keeping reasoning items in context

When doing [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling) with a reasoning model in the [Responses API](/docs/apit-reference/responses), we highly recommend you pass back any reasoning items returned with the last function call (in addition to the output of your function). If the model calls multiple functions consecutively, you should pass back all reasoning items, function call items, and function call output items, since the last `user` message. This allows the model to continue its reasoning process to produce better results in the most token-efficient manner.

The simplest way to do this is to pass in all reasoning items from a previous response into the next one. Our systems will smartly ignore any reasoning items that aren't relevant to your functions, and only retain those in context that are relevant. You can pass reasoning items from previous responses either using the `previous_response_id` parameter, or by manually passing in all the [output](/docs/api-reference/responses/object#responses/object-output) items from a past response into the [input](/docs/api-reference/responses/create#responses-create-input) of a new one.

For advanced use cases where you might be truncating and optimizing parts of the context window before passing them on to the next response, just ensure all items between the last user message and your function call output are passed into the next response untouched. This will ensure that the model has all the context it needs.

Check out [this guide](/docs/guides/conversation-state) to learn more about manual context management.

### Encrypted reasoning items

When using the Responses API in a stateless mode (either with `store` set to `false`, or when an organization is enrolled in zero data retention), you must still retain reasoning items across conversation turns using the techniques described above. But in order to have reasoning items that can be sent with subsequent API requests, each of your API requests must have `reasoning.encrypted_content` in the `include` parameter of API requests, like so:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o4-mini",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"},
    "input": "What is the weather like today?",
    "tools": [ ... function config here ... ],
    "include": [ "reasoning.encrypted_content" ]
  }'
```

Any reasoning items in the `output` array will now have an `encrypted_content` property, which will contain encrypted reasoning tokens that can be passed along with future conversation turns.

Reasoning summaries
-------------------

While we don't expose the raw reasoning tokens emitted by the model, you can view a summary of the model's reasoning using the the `summary` parameter.

Different models support different reasoning summarizers—for example, our computer use model supports the `concise` summarizer, while o4-mini supports `detailed`. To simply access the most detailed summarizer available, set the value of this parameter to `auto` and view the reasoning summary as part of the `summary` array in the `reasoning` [output](/docs/api-reference/responses/object#responses/object-output) item.

This feature is also supported with streaming, and across the following reasoning models: `o4-mini`, `o3`, `o3-mini` and `o1`.

Before using summarizers with our latest reasoning models, you may need to complete [organization verification](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification) to ensure safe deployment. Get started with verification on the [platform settings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general).

Generate a summary of the reasoning

```json
reasoning: {
  effort: "medium", // unchanged
  summary: "auto" // auto gives you the best available summary (detailed > auto > None)
}
```

Advice on prompting
-------------------

There are some differences to consider when prompting a reasoning model. Reasoning models provide better results on tasks with only high-level guidance, while GPT models often benefit from very precise instructions.

*   A reasoning model is like a senior co-worker—you can give them a goal to achieve and trust them to work out the details.
*   A GPT model is like a junior coworker—they'll perform best with explicit instructions to create a specific output.

For more information on best practices when using reasoning models, [refer to this guide](/docs/guides/reasoning-best-practices).

### Prompt examples

Coding (refactoring)

OpenAI o-series models are able to implement complex algorithms and produce code. This prompt asks o1 to refactor a React component based on some specific criteria.

Refactor code

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
Instructions:
- Given the React component below, change it so that nonfiction books have red
  text. 
- Return only the code in your reply
- Do not include any additional formatting, such as markdown code blocks
- For formatting, use four space tabs, and do not allow any lines of code to 
  exceed 80 columns

const books = [
  { title: 'Dune', category: 'fiction', id: 1 },
  { title: 'Frankenstein', category: 'fiction', id: 2 },
  { title: 'Moneyball', category: 'nonfiction', id: 3 },
];

export default function BookList() {
  const listItems = books.map(book =>
    <li>
      {book.title}
    </li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
`.trim();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "o4-mini",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
Instructions:
- Given the React component below, change it so that nonfiction books have red
  text. 
- Return only the code in your reply
- Do not include any additional formatting, such as markdown code blocks

const books = [
  { title: 'Dune', category: 'fiction', id: 1 },
  { title: 'Frankenstein', category: 'fiction', id: 2 },
  { title: 'Moneyball', category: 'nonfiction', id: 3 },
];

export default function BookList() {
  const listItems = books.map(book =>
    <li>
      {book.title}
    </li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt,
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Coding (planning)

OpenAI o-series models are also adept in creating multi-step plans. This example prompt asks o1 to create a filesystem structure for a full solution, along with Python code that implements the desired use case.

Plan and create a Python project

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
I want to build a Python app that takes user questions and looks 
them up in a database where they are mapped to answers. If there 
is close match, it retrieves the matched answer. If there isn't, 
it asks the user to provide an answer and stores the 
question/answer pair in the database. Make a plan for the directory 
structure you'll need, then return each file in full. Only supply 
your reasoning at the beginning and end, not throughout the code.
`.trim();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "o4-mini",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
I want to build a Python app that takes user questions and looks 
them up in a database where they are mapped to answers. If there 
is close match, it retrieves the matched answer. If there isn't, 
it asks the user to provide an answer and stores the 
question/answer pair in the database. Make a plan for the directory 
structure you'll need, then return each file in full. Only supply 
your reasoning at the beginning and end, not throughout the code.
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt,
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

STEM Research

OpenAI o-series models have shown excellent performance in STEM research. Prompts asking for support of basic research tasks should show strong results.

Ask questions related to basic scientific research

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const prompt = `
What are three compounds we should consider investigating to 
advance research into new antibiotics? Why should we consider 
them?
`;

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "o4-mini",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = """
What are three compounds we should consider investigating to 
advance research into new antibiotics? Why should we consider 
them?
"""

response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": prompt
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Streaming API responses
=======================

Learn how to stream model responses from the OpenAI API using server-sent events.

By default, when you make a request to the OpenAI API, we generate the model's entire output before sending it back in a single HTTP response. When generating long outputs, waiting for a response can take time. Streaming responses lets you start printing or processing the beginning of the model's output while it continues generating the full response.

Enable streaming
----------------

To start streaming responses, set `stream=True` in your request to the Responses endpoint:

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const stream = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
        },
    ],
    stream: true,
});

for await (const event of stream) {
    console.log(event);
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
        },
    ],
    stream=True,
)

for event in stream:
    print(event)
```

The Responses API uses semantic events for streaming. Each event is typed with a predefined schema, so you can listen for events you care about.

For a full list of event types, see the [API reference for streaming](/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming). Here are a few examples:

```python
type StreamingEvent = 
    | ResponseCreatedEvent
    | ResponseInProgressEvent
    | ResponseFailedEvent
    | ResponseCompletedEvent
    | ResponseOutputItemAdded
    | ResponseOutputItemDone
    | ResponseContentPartAdded
    | ResponseContentPartDone
    | ResponseOutputTextDelta
    | ResponseOutputTextAnnotationAdded
    | ResponseTextDone
    | ResponseRefusalDelta
    | ResponseRefusalDone
    | ResponseFunctionCallArgumentsDelta
    | ResponseFunctionCallArgumentsDone
    | ResponseFileSearchCallInProgress
    | ResponseFileSearchCallSearching
    | ResponseFileSearchCallCompleted
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterInProgress
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterCallCodeDelta
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterCallCodeDone
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterCallIntepreting
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterCallCompleted
    | Error
```

Read the responses
------------------

If you're using our SDK, every event is a typed instance. You can also identity individual events using the `type` property of the event.

Some key lifecycle events are emitted only once, while others are emitted multiple times as the response is generated. Common events to listen for when streaming text are:

```text
- `response.created`
- `response.output_text.delta`
- `response.completed`
- `error`
```

For a full list of events you can listen for, see the [API reference for streaming](/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming).

Advanced use cases
------------------

For more advanced use cases, like streaming tool calls, check out the following dedicated guides:

*   [Streaming function calls](/docs/guides/function-calling#streaming)
*   [Streaming structured output](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#streaming)

Moderation risk
---------------

Note that streaming the model's output in a production application makes it more difficult to moderate the content of the completions, as partial completions may be more difficult to evaluate. This may have implications for approved usage.

Background mode
===============

Run long running tasks asynchronously in the background.

Agents like [Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/) and [Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) show that reasoning models can take several minutes to solve complex problems. Background mode enables you to execute long-running tasks on models like o3 and o1-pro reliably, without having to worry about timeouts or other connectivity issues.

Background mode kicks off these tasks asynchronously, and developers can poll response objects to check status over time. To start response generation in the background, make an API request with `background` set to `true`:

Generate a response in the background

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o3",
    "input": "Write a very long novel about otters in space.",
    "background": true
  }'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "o3",
    input: "Write a very long novel about otters in space.",
    background: true,
});

console.log(resp.status);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="o3",
    input="Write a very long novel about otters in space.",
    background=True,
)

print(resp.status)
```

Polling background responses
----------------------------

To check the status of background requests, use the GET endpoint for Responses. Keep polling while the request is in the queued or in\_progress state. When it leaves these states, it has reached a final (terminal) state.

Retrieve a response executing in the background

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses/resp_123 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

let resp = await client.responses.create({
  model: "o3",
  input: "Write a very long novel about otters in space.",
  background: true,
});

while (resp.status === "queued" || resp.status === "in_progress") {
  console.log("Current status: " + resp.status);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // wait 2 seconds
  resp = await client.responses.retrieve(resp.id);
}

console.log("Final status: " + resp.status + "\nOutput:\n" + resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from time import sleep

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="o3",
    input="Write a very long novel about otters in space.",
    background=True,
)

while resp.status in {"queued", "in_progress"}:
    print(f"Current status: {resp.status}")
    sleep(2)
    resp = client.responses.retrieve(resp.id)

print(f"Final status: {resp.status}\nOutput:\n{resp.output_text}")
```

Cancelling a background response
--------------------------------

You can also cancel an in-flight response like this:

Cancel an ongoing response

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/responses/resp_123/cancel \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.cancel("resp_123");

console.log(resp.status);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.cancel("resp_123")

print(resp.status)
```

Cancelling twice is idempotent - subsequent calls simply return the final `Response` object.

Streaming a background response
-------------------------------

You can create a background Response and start streaming events from it right away. This may be helpful if you expect the client to drop the stream and want the option of picking it back up later. To do this, create a Response with both `background` and `stream` set to `true`. You will want to keep track of a "cursor" corresponding to the `sequence_number` you receive in each streaming event.

Currently, the time to first token you receive from a background response is higher than what you receive from a synchronous one. We are working to reduce this latency gap in the coming weeks.

Generate and stream a background response

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o3",
    "input": "Write a very long novel about otters in space.",
    "background": true,
    "stream": true
  }'

// To resume:
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses/resp_123?stream=true&starting_after=42" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const stream = await client.responses.create({
    model: "o3",
    input: "Write a very long novel about otters in space.",
    background: true,
    stream: true,
});

let cursor = null;
for await (const event of stream) {
    console.log(event);
    cursor = event.sequence_number;
}

// If the connection drops, you can resume streaming from the last cursor (SDK support coming soon):
// const resumedStream = await client.responses.stream(resp.id, { starting_after: cursor });
// for await (const event of resumedStream) { ... }
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Fire off an async response but also start streaming immediately
stream = client.responses.create(
    model="o3",
    input="Write a very long novel about otters in space.",
    background=True,
    stream=True,
)

cursor = None
for event in stream:
    print(event)
    cursor = event.sequence_number

# If your connection drops, the response continues running and you can reconnect:
# SDK support for resuming the stream is coming soon.
# for event in client.responses.stream(resp.id, starting_after=cursor):
#     print(event)
```

Limits
------

1.  Background sampling requires `store=true`; stateless requests are rejected.
2.  To cancel a synchronous response, terminate the connection
3.  You can only start a new stream from a background response if you created it with `stream=true`.

Using tools
===========

Use tools like remote MCP servers or web search to extend the model's capabilities.

When generating model responses, you can extend model capabilities using built-in **tools**. These tools help models access additional context and information from the web or your files. The example below uses the [web search tool](/docs/guides/tools-web-search) to use the latest information from the web to generate a model response.

Include web search results for the model response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [ { type: "web_search_preview" } ],
    input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

You can include several built-in tools from the available tools list below and let the model decide which tools to use based on the conversation.

Available tools

](/docs/guides/tools-computer-use)

Usage in the API
----------------

When making a request to generate a [model response](/docs/api-reference/responses/create), you can enable tool access by specifying configurations in the `tools` parameter. Each tool has its own unique configuration requirements—see the [Available tools](#available-tools) section for detailed instructions.

Based on the provided [prompt](/docs/guides/text), the model automatically decides whether to use a configured tool. For instance, if your prompt requests information beyond the model's training cutoff date and web search is enabled, the model will typically invoke the web search tool to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information.

You can explicitly control or guide this behavior by setting the `tool_choice` parameter [in the API request](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

### Function calling

In addition to built-in tools, you can define custom functions using the `tools` array. These custom functions allow the model to call your application's code, enabling access to specific data or capabilities not directly available within the model.

Learn more in the [function calling guide](/docs/guides/function-calling).

Remote MCP
==========

Allow models to use remote MCP servers to perform tasks.

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide tools and context to LLMs. The MCP tool in the Responses API allows developers to give the model access to tools hosted on **Remote MCP servers**. These are MCP servers maintained by developers and organizations across the internet that expose these tools to MCP clients, like the Responses API.

Calling a remote MCP server with the Responses API is straightforward. For example, here's how you can use the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/) MCP server to ask questions about nearly any public GitHub repository.

A Responses API request with MCP tools enabled

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
      "require_approval": "never"
    }
  ],
  "input": "What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?"
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [
        {
            type: "mcp",
            server_label: "deepwiki",
            server_url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
            require_approval: "never",
        },
    ],
    input: "What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?",
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "deepwiki",
            "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
            "require_approval": "never",
        },
    ],
    input="What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

It is very important that developers trust any remote MCP server they use with the Responses API. A malicious server can exfiltrate sensitive data from anything that enters the model's context. Carefully review the [Risks and Safety](#risks-and-safety) section below before using this tool.

The MCP ecosystem
-----------------

We are still in the early days of the MCP ecosystem. Some popular remote MCP servers today include [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/guides/remote-mcp-server/), [Hubspot](https://developers.hubspot.com/mcp), [Intercom](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/mcp), [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/tools/mcp-server/), [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/openai/), [Plaid](https://plaid.com/docs/mcp/), [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/storefront-mcp), [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/mcp), [Square](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mcp), [Twilio](https://github.com/twilio-labs/function-templates/tree/main/mcp-server) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/mcp). We expect many more servers—and registries making it easy to discover these servers—to launch in the coming months. The MCP protocol itself is also early, and we expect to add many more updates to our MCP tool as the protocol evolves.

How it works
------------

The MCP tool works only in the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses/create), and is available across all our new models (gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, and our reasoning models). When you're using the MCP tool, you only pay for [tokens](/docs/pricing) used when importing tool definitions or making tool calls—there are no additional fees involved.

### Step 1: Getting the list of tools from the MCP server

The first thing the Responses API does when you attach a remote MCP server to the `tools` array, is attempt to get a list of tools from the server. The Responses API supports remote MCP servers that support either the Streamable HTTP or the HTTP/SSE transport protocol.

If successful in retrieving the list of tools, a new `mcp_list_tools` output item will be visible in the Response object that is created for each MCP server. The `tools` property of this object will show the tools that were successfully imported.

```json
{
  "id": "mcpl_682d4379df088191886b70f4ec39f90403937d5f622d7a90",
  "type": "mcp_list_tools",
  "server_label": "deepwiki",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "read_wiki_structure",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "repoName": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "GitHub repository: owner/repo (e.g. \"facebook/react\")"
          }
        },
        "required": [
          "repoName"
        ],
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "annotations": null,
        "description": "",
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
      }
    },
    // ... other tools
  ]
}
```

As long as the `mcp_list_tools` item is present in the context of the model, we will not attempt to pull a refreshed list of tools from an MCP server. We recommend you keep this item in the model's context as part of every conversation or workflow execution to optimize for latency.

#### Filtering tools

Some MCP servers can have dozens of tools, and exposing many tools to the model can result in high cost and latency. If you're only interested in a subset of tools an MCP server exposes, you can use the `allowed_tools` parameter to only import those tools.

Constrain allowed tools

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
      "require_approval": "never",
      "allowed_tools": ["ask_question"]
    }
  ],
  "input": "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?"
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [{
        type: "mcp",
        server_label: "deepwiki",
        server_url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
        require_approval: "never",
        allowed_tools: ["ask_question"],
    }],
    input: "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "deepwiki",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "allowed_tools": ["ask_question"],
    }],
    input="What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

### Step 2: Calling tools

Once the model has access to these tool definitions, it may choose to call them depending on what's in the model's context. When the model decides to call an MCP tool, we make an request to the remote MCP server to call the tool, take it's output and put that into the model's context. This creates an `mcp_call` item which looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "mcp_682d437d90a88191bf88cd03aae0c3e503937d5f622d7a90",
  "type": "mcp_call",
  "approval_request_id": null,
  "arguments": "{\"repoName\":\"modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol\",\"question\":\"What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec support?\"}",
  "error": null,
  "name": "ask_question",
  "output": "The 2025-03-26 version of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification supports two standard transport mechanisms: `stdio` and `Streamable HTTP` ...",
  "server_label": "deepwiki"
}
```

As you can see, this includes both the arguments the model decided to use for this tool call, and the `output` that the remote MCP server returned. All models can choose to make multiple (MCP) tool calls in the Responses API, and so, you may see several of these items generated in a single Response API request.

Failed tool calls will populate the error field of this item with MCP protocol errors, MCP tool execution errors, or general connectivity errors. The MCP errors are documented in the MCP spec [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/tools#error-handling).

#### Approvals

By default, OpenAI will request your approval before any data is shared with a remote MCP server. Approvals help you maintain control and visibility over what data is being sent to an MCP server. We highly recommend that you carefully review (and optionally, log) all data being shared with a remote MCP server. A request for an approval to make an MCP tool call creates a `mcp_approval_request` item in the Response's output that looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa",
  "type": "mcp_approval_request",
  "arguments": "{\"repoName\":\"modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol\",\"question\":\"What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?\"}",
  "name": "ask_question",
  "server_label": "deepwiki"
}
```

You can then respond to this by creating a new Response object and appending an `mcp_approval_response` item to it.

Approving the use of tools in an API request

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp"
    }
  ],
  "previous_response_id": "resp_682d498bdefc81918b4a6aa477bfafd904ad1e533afccbfa",
  "input": [{
    "type": "mcp_approval_response",
    "approve": true,
    "approval_request_id": "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa"
  }]
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [{
        type: "mcp",
        server_label: "deepwiki",
        server_url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
    }],
    previous_response_id: "resp_682d498bdefc81918b4a6aa477bfafd904ad1e533afccbfa",
    input: [{
        type: "mcp_approval_response",
        approve: true,
        approval_request_id: "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa"
    }],
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "deepwiki",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
    }],
    previous_response_id="resp_682d498bdefc81918b4a6aa477bfafd904ad1e533afccbfa",
    input=[{
        "type": "mcp_approval_response",
        "approve": True,
        "approval_request_id": "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa"
    }],
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

Here we're using the `previous_response_id` parameter to chain this new Response, with the previous Response that generated the approval request. But you can also pass back the [outputs from one response, as inputs into another](/docs/guides/conversation-state#manually-manage-conversation-state) for maximum control over what enter's the model's context.

If and when you feel comfortable trusting a remote MCP server, you can choose to skip the approvals for reduced latency. To do this, you can set the `require_approval` parameter of the MCP tool to an object listing just the tools you'd like to skip approvals for like shown below, or set it to the value `'never'` to skip approvals for all tools in that remote MCP server.

Never require approval for some tools

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
      "require_approval": {
          "never": {
            "tool_names": ["ask_question", "read_wiki_structure"]
          }
      }
    }
  ],
  "input": "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?"
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [

                    tool_names: ["ask_question", "read_wiki_structure"]
                }
            }
        },
    ],
    input: "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[

            "server_label": "deepwiki",
            "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
            "require_approval": {
                "never": {
                    "tool_names": ["ask_question", "read_wiki_structure"]
                }
            }
        },
    ],
    input="What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

Authentication
--------------

Unlike the DeepWiki MCP server, most other MCP servers require authentication. The MCP tool in the Responses API gives you the ability to flexibly specify headers that should be included in any request made to a remote MCP server. These headers can be used to share API keys, oAuth access tokens, or any other authentication scheme the remote MCP server implements.

The most common header used by remote MCP servers is the `Authorization` header. This is what passing this header looks like:

Use Stripe MCP tool

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "input": "Create a payment link for $20",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "stripe",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.stripe.com",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer $STRIPE_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: "Create a payment link for $20",
    tools: [
        {
            type: "mcp",
            server_label: "stripe",
            server_url: "https://mcp.stripe.com",
            headers: {
                Authorization: "Bearer $STRIPE_API_KEY"
            }
        }
    ]
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="Create a payment link for $20",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "stripe",
            "server_url": "https://mcp.stripe.com",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer $STRIPE_API_KEY"
            }
        }
    ]
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

To prevent the leakage of sensitive keys, the Responses API does not store the values of **any** string you provide in the `headers` object. These values will also not be visible in the Response object created. Additionally, because some remote MCP servers generate authenticated URLs, we also discard the _path_ portion of the `server_url` in our responses (i.e. `example.com/mcp` becomes `example.com`). Because of this, you must send the full path of the MCP `server_url` and any relevant `headers` in every Responses API creation request you make.

Risks and safety
----------------

The MCP tool permits you to connect OpenAI to services that have not been verified by OpenAI and allows OpenAI to access, send and receive data, and take action in these services. All MCP servers are third-party services that are subject to their own terms and conditions.

If you come across a malicious MCP server, please report it to `security@openai.com`.

#### Connecting to trusted servers

Pick official servers hosted by the service providers themselves (e.g. we recommend connecting to the Stripe server hosted by Stripe themselves on mcp.stripe.com, instead of a Stripe MCP server hosted by a third party). Because there aren't too many official remote MCP servers today, you may be tempted to use a MCP server hosted by an organization that doesn't operate that server and simply proxies request to that service via your API. If you must do this, be extra careful in doing your due diligence on these "aggregators", and carefully review how they use your data.

#### Log and review data being shared with third party MCP servers.

Because MCP servers define their own tool definitions, they may request for data that you may not always be comfortable sharing with the host of that MCP server. Because of this, the MCP tool in the Responses API defaults to requiring approvals of each MCP tool call being made. When developing your application, review the type of data being shared with these MCP servers carefully and robustly. Once you gain confidence in your trust of this MCP server, you can skip these approvals for more performant execution.

We also recommend logging any data sent to MCP servers. If you're using the Responses API with `store=true`, these data are already logged via the API for 30 days unless Zero Data Retention is enabled for your organization. You may also want to log these data in your own systems and perform periodic reviews on this to ensure data is being shared per your expectations.

Malicious MCP servers may include hidden instructions (prompt injections) designed to make OpenAI models behave unexpectedly. While OpenAI has implemented built-in safeguards to help detect and block these threats, it's essential to carefully review inputs and outputs, and ensure connections are established only with trusted servers.

MCP servers may update tool behavior unexpectedly, potentially leading to unintended or malicious behavior.

#### Implications on Zero Data Retention and Data Residency

The MCP tool is compatible with Zero Data Retention and Data Residency, but it's important to note that MCP servers are third-party services, and data sent to an MCP server is subject to their data retention and data residency policies.

In other words, if you're an organization with Data Residency in Europe, OpenAI will limit inference and storage of Customer Content to take place in Europe up until the point communication or data is sent to the MCP server. It is your responsibility to ensure that the MCP server also adheres to any Zero Data Retention or Data Residency requirements you may have. Learn more about Zero Data Retention and Data Residency [here](/docs/guides/your-data).

Web search
==========

Allow models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.

Using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses), you can enable web search by configuring it in the `tools` array in an API request to generate content. Like any other tool, the model can choose to search the web or not based on the content of the input prompt.

Web search tool example

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [ { type: "web_search_preview" } ],
    input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

Web search tool versions

The current default version of the web search tool is:

`web_search_preview`

Which points to a dated version:

`web_search_preview_2025_03_11`

As the tool evolves, future dated snapshot versions will be documented in the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

You can also force the use of the `web_search_preview` tool by using the `tool_choice` parameter, and setting it to `{type: "web_search_preview"}` - this can help ensure lower latency and more consistent results.

Output and citations
--------------------

Model responses that use the web search tool will include two parts:

*   A `web_search_call` output item with the ID of the search call.
*   A `message` output item containing:
    *   The text result in `message.content[0].text`
    *   Annotations `message.content[0].annotations` for the cited URLs

By default, the model's response will include inline citations for URLs found in the web search results. In addition to this, the `url_citation` annotation object will contain the URL, title and location of the cited source.

When displaying web results or information contained in web results to end users, inline citations must be made clearly visible and clickable in your user interface.

```json
[
  {
    "type": "web_search_call",
    "id": "ws_67c9fa0502748190b7dd390736892e100be649c1a5ff9609",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  {
    "id": "msg_67c9fa077e288190af08fdffda2e34f20be649c1a5ff9609",
    "type": "message",
    "status": "completed",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "output_text",
        "text": "On March 6, 2025, several news...",
        "annotations": [
          {
            "type": "url_citation",
            "start_index": 2606,
            "end_index": 2758,
            "url": "https://...",
            "title": "Title..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

User location
-------------

To refine search results based on geography, you can specify an approximate user location using country, city, region, and/or timezone.

*   The `city` and `region` fields are free text strings, like `Minneapolis` and `Minnesota` respectively.
*   The `country` field is a two-letter [ISO country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1), like `US`.
*   The `timezone` field is an [IANA timezone](https://timeapi.io/documentation/iana-timezones) like `America/Chicago`.

Customizing user location

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "web_search_preview",
        "user_location": {
            "type": "approximate",
            "country": "GB",
            "city": "London",
            "region": "London",
        }
    }],
    input="What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [{
        type: "web_search_preview",
        user_location: {
            type: "approximate",
            country: "GB",
            city: "London",
            region: "London"
        }
    }],
    input: "What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?",
});
console.log(response.output_text);
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "tools": [{
            "type": "web_search_preview",
            "user_location": {
                "type": "approximate",
                "country": "GB",
                "city": "London",
                "region": "London"
            }
        }],
        "input": "What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?"
    }'
```

Search context size
-------------------

When using this tool, the `search_context_size` parameter controls how much context is retrieved from the web to help the tool formulate a response. The tokens used by the search tool do **not** affect the context window of the main model specified in the `model` parameter in your response creation request. These tokens are also **not** carried over from one turn to another — they're simply used to formulate the tool response and then discarded.

Choosing a context size impacts:

*   **Cost**: Pricing of our search tool varies based on the value of this parameter. Higher context sizes are more expensive. See tool pricing [here](/docs/pricing).
*   **Quality**: Higher search context sizes generally provide richer context, resulting in more accurate, comprehensive answers.
*   **Latency**: Higher context sizes require processing more tokens, which can slow down the tool's response time.

Available values:

*   **`high`**: Most comprehensive context, highest cost, slower response.
*   **`medium`** (default): Balanced context, cost, and latency.
*   **`low`**: Least context, lowest cost, fastest response, but potentially lower answer quality.

Again, tokens used by the search tool do **not** impact main model's token usage and are not carried over from turn to turn. Check the [pricing page](/docs/pricing) for details on costs associated with each context size.

Customizing search context size

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "web_search_preview",
        "search_context_size": "low",
    }],
    input="What movie won best picture in 2025?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [{
        type: "web_search_preview",
        search_context_size: "low",
    }],
    input: "What movie won best picture in 2025?",
});
console.log(response.output_text);
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "tools": [{
            "type": "web_search_preview",
            "search_context_size": "low"
        }],
        "input": "What movie won best picture in 2025?"
    }'
```

File search
===========

Allow models to search your files for relevant information before generating a response.

File search is a tool available in the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses). It enables models to retrieve information in a knowledge base of previously uploaded files through semantic and keyword search. By creating vector stores and uploading files to them, you can augment the models' inherent knowledge by giving them access to these knowledge bases or `vector_stores`.

To learn more about how vector stores and semantic search work, refer to our [retrieval guide](/docs/guides/retrieval).

This is a hosted tool managed by OpenAI, meaning you don't have to implement code on your end to handle its execution. When the model decides to use it, it will automatically call the tool, retrieve information from your files, and return an output.

How to use
----------

Prior to using file search with the Responses API, you need to have set up a knowledge base in a vector store and uploaded files to it.

Create a vector store and upload a file

Follow these steps to create a vector store and upload a file to it. You can use [this example file](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/deep_research_blog.pdf) or upload your own.

#### Upload the file to the File API

Upload a file

```python
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def create_file(client, file_path):
    if file_path.startswith("http://") or file_path.startswith("https://"):
        # Download the file content from the URL
        response = requests.get(file_path)
        file_content = BytesIO(response.content)
        file_name = file_path.split("/")[-1]
        file_tuple = (file_name, file_content)
        result = client.files.create(
            file=file_tuple,
            purpose="assistants"
        )
    else:
        # Handle local file path
        with open(file_path, "rb") as file_content:
            result = client.files.create(
                file=file_content,
                purpose="assistants"
            )
    print(result.id)
    return result.id

# Replace with your own file path or URL
file_id = create_file(client, "https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/deep_research_blog.pdf")
```

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

async function createFile(filePath) {
  let result;
  if (filePath.startsWith("http://") || filePath.startsWith("https://")) {
    // Download the file content from the URL
    const res = await fetch(filePath);
    const buffer = await res.arrayBuffer();
    const urlParts = filePath.split("/");
    const fileName = urlParts[urlParts.length - 1];
    const file = new File([buffer], fileName);
    result = await openai.files.create({
      file: file,
      purpose: "assistants",
    });
  } else {
    // Handle local file path
    const fileContent = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
    result = await openai.files.create({
      file: fileContent,
      purpose: "assistants",
    });
  }
  return result.id;
}

// Replace with your own file path or URL
const fileId = await createFile(
  "https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/deep_research_blog.pdf"
);

console.log(fileId);
```

#### Create a vector store

Create a vector store

```python
vector_store = client.vector_stores.create(
    name="knowledge_base"
)
print(vector_store.id)
```

```javascript
const vectorStore = await openai.vectorStores.create({
    name: "knowledge_base",
});
console.log(vectorStore.id);
```

#### Add the file to the vector store

Add a file to a vector store

```python
client.vector_stores.files.create(
    vector_store_id=vector_store.id,
    file_id=file_id
)
print(result)
```

```javascript
await openai.vectorStores.files.create(
    vectorStore.id,
    {
        file_id: fileId,
    }
});
```

#### Check status

Run this code until the file is ready to be used (i.e., when the status is `completed`).

Check status

```python
result = client.vector_stores.files.list(
    vector_store_id=vector_store.id
)
print(result)
```

```javascript
const result = await openai.vectorStores.files.list({
    vector_store_id: vectorStore.id,
});
console.log(result);
```

Once your knowledge base is set up, you can include the `file_search` tool in the list of tools available to the model, along with the list of vector stores in which to search.

File search tool

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [{
        type: "file_search",
        vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
    }],
});
console.log(response);
```

When this tool is called by the model, you will receive a response with multiple outputs:

1.  A `file_search_call` output item, which contains the id of the file search call.
2.  A `message` output item, which contains the response from the model, along with the file citations.

File search response

              "filename": "deep_research_blog.pdf"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Retrieval customization
-----------------------

### Limiting the number of results

Using the file search tool with the Responses API, you can customize the number of results you want to retrieve from the vector stores. This can help reduce both token usage and latency, but may come at the cost of reduced answer quality.

Limit the number of results

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"],
        "max_num_results": 2
    }]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [{
        type: "file_search",
        vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
        max_num_results: 2,
    }],
});
console.log(response);
```

### Include search results in the response

While you can see annotations (references to files) in the output text, the file search call will not return search results by default.

To include search results in the response, you can use the `include` parameter when creating the response.

Include search results

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }],
    include=["file_search_call.results"]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [{
        type: "file_search",
        vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
    }],
    include: ["file_search_call.results"],
});
console.log(response);
```

### Metadata filtering

You can filter the search results based on the metadata of the files. For more details, refer to our [retrieval guide](/docs/guides/retrieval), which covers:

*   How to [set attributes on vector store files](/docs/guides/retrieval#attributes)
*   How to [define filters](/docs/guides/retrieval#attribute-filtering)

Metadata filtering

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"],
        "filters": {
            "type": "eq",
            "key": "type",
            "value": "blog"
        }
    }]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [{
        type: "file_search",
        vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
        filters: {
            type: "eq",
            key: "type",
            value: "blog"
        }
    }]
});
console.log(response);
```

Image generation
================

Allow models to generate or edit images.

The image generation tool allows you to generate images using a text prompt, and optionally image inputs. It leverages the [GPT Image model](/docs/models/gpt-image-1), and automatically optimizes text inputs for improved performance.

To learn more about image generation, refer to our dedicated [image generation guide](/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=gpt-image-1&api=responses).

Usage
-----

When you include the `image_generation` tool in your request, the model can decide when and how to generate images as part of the conversation, using your prompt and any provided image inputs.

The `image_generation_call` tool call result will include a base64-encoded image.

Generate an image

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    input: "Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
    tools: [{type: "image_generation"}],
});

// Save the image to a file
const imageData = response.output
  .filter((output) => output.type === "image_generation_call")
  .map((output) => output.result);

if (imageData.length > 0) {
  const imageBase64 = imageData[0];
  const fs = await import("fs");
  fs.writeFileSync("otter.png", Buffer.from(imageBase64, "base64"));
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI() 

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input="Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation"}],
)

# Save the image to a file
image_data = [
    output.result
    for output in response.output
    if output.type == "image_generation_call"
]
    
if image_data:
    image_base64 = image_data[0]
    with open("otter.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(image_base64))
```

You can [provide input images](/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=gpt-image-1#edit-images) using file IDs or base64 data.

To force the image generation tool call, you can set the parameter `tool_choice` to `{"type": "image_generation"}`.

### Tool options

You can configure the following output options as parameters for the [image generation tool](/docs/api-reference/responses/create#responses-create-tools):

*   Size: Image dimensions (e.g., 1024x1024, 1024x1536)
*   Quality: Rendering quality (e.g. low, medium, high)
*   Format: File output format
*   Compression: Compression level (0-100%) for JPEG and WebP formats
*   Background: Transparent or opaque

`size`, `quality`, and `background` support the `auto` option, where the model will automatically select the best option based on the prompt.

For more details on available options, refer to the [image generation guide](/docs/guides/image-generation#customize-image-output).

### Revised prompt

When using the image generation tool, the mainline model (e.g. `gpt-4.1`) will automatically revise your prompt for improved performance.

You can access the revised prompt in the `revised_prompt` field of the image generation call:

```json
{
  "id": "ig_123",
  "type": "image_generation_call",
  "status": "completed",
  "revised_prompt": "A gray tabby cat hugging an otter. The otter is wearing an orange scarf. Both animals are cute and friendly, depicted in a warm, heartwarming style.",
  "result": "..."
}
```

### Prompting tips

Image generation works best when you use terms like "draw" or "edit" in your prompt.

For example, if you want to combine images, instead of saying "combine" or "merge", you can say something like "edit the first image by adding this element from the second image".

Multi-turn editing
------------------

You can iteratively edit images by referencing previous response or image IDs. This allows you to refine images across multiple turns in a conversation.

Using previous response ID

Multi-turn image generation

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
  input:
    "Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
  tools: [{ type: "image_generation" }],
});

const imageData = response.output
  .filter((output) => output.type === "image_generation_call")
  .map((output) => output.result);

if (imageData.length > 0) {
  const imageBase64 = imageData[0];
  const fs = await import("fs");
  fs.writeFileSync("cat_and_otter.png", Buffer.from(imageBase64, "base64"));
}

// Follow up

const response_fwup = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
  previous_response_id: response.id,
  input: "Now make it look realistic",
  tools: [{ type: "image_generation" }],
});

const imageData_fwup = response_fwup.output
  .filter((output) => output.type === "image_generation_call")
  .map((output) => output.result);

if (imageData_fwup.length > 0) {
  const imageBase64 = imageData_fwup[0];
  const fs = await import("fs");
  fs.writeFileSync(
    "cat_and_otter_realistic.png",
    Buffer.from(imageBase64, "base64")
  );
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input="Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation"}],
)

image_data = [
    output.result
    for output in response.output
    if output.type == "image_generation_call"
]

if image_data:
    image_base64 = image_data[0]

    with open("cat_and_otter.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(image_base64))

# Follow up

response_fwup = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    previous_response_id=response.id,
    input="Now make it look realistic",
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation"}],
)

image_data_fwup = [
    output.result
    for output in response_fwup.output
    if output.type == "image_generation_call"
]

if image_data_fwup:
    image_base64 = image_data_fwup[0]
    with open("cat_and_otter_realistic.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(image_base64))
```

Using image ID

Multi-turn image generation

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
  input:
    "Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
  tools: [{ type: "image_generation" }],
});

const imageGenerationCalls = response.output.filter(
  (output) => output.type === "image_generation_call"
);

const imageData = imageGenerationCalls.map((output) => output.result);

if (imageData.length > 0) {
  const imageBase64 = imageData[0];
  const fs = await import("fs");
  fs.writeFileSync("cat_and_otter.png", Buffer.from(imageBase64, "base64"));
}

// Follow up

const response_fwup = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
  input: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: [{ type: "input_text", text: "Now make it look realistic" }],
    },
    {
      type: "image_generation_call",
      id: imageGenerationCalls[0].id,
    },
  ],
  tools: [{ type: "image_generation" }],
});

const imageData_fwup = response_fwup.output
  .filter((output) => output.type === "image_generation_call")
  .map((output) => output.result);

if (imageData_fwup.length > 0) {
  const imageBase64 = imageData_fwup[0];
  const fs = await import("fs");
  fs.writeFileSync(
    "cat_and_otter_realistic.png",
    Buffer.from(imageBase64, "base64")
  );
}
```

```python
import openai
import base64

response = openai.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input="Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation"}],
)

image_generation_calls = [
    output
    for output in response.output
    if output.type == "image_generation_call"
]

image_data = [output.result for output in image_generation_calls]

if image_data:
    image_base64 = image_data[0]

    with open("cat_and_otter.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(image_base64))

# Follow up

response_fwup = openai.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": "Now make it look realistic"}],
        },
        {
            "type": "image_generation_call",
            "id": image_generation_calls[0].id,
        },
    ],
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation"}],
)

image_data_fwup = [
    output.result
    for output in response_fwup.output
    if output.type == "image_generation_call"
]

if image_data_fwup:
    image_base64 = image_data_fwup[0]
    with open("cat_and_otter_realistic.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(image_base64))
```

Streaming
---------

The image generation tool supports streaming partial images as the final result is being generated. This provides faster visual feedback for users and improves perceived latency.

You can set the number of partial images (1-3) with the `partial_images` parameter.

Stream an image

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import fs from "fs";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const stream = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  input:
    "Draw a gorgeous image of a river made of white owl feathers, snaking its way through a serene winter landscape",
  stream: true,
  tools: [{ type: "image_generation", partial_images: 2 }],
});

for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.type === "response.image_generation_call.partial_image") {
    const idx = event.partial_image_index;
    const imageBase64 = event.partial_image_b64;
    const imageBuffer = Buffer.from(imageBase64, "base64");
    fs.writeFileSync(`river${idx}.png`, imageBuffer);
  }
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI()

stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="Draw a gorgeous image of a river made of white owl feathers, snaking its way through a serene winter landscape",
    stream=True,
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation", "partial_images": 2}],
)

for event in stream:
    if event.type == "response.image_generation_call.partial_image":
        idx = event.partial_image_index
        image_base64 = event.partial_image_b64
        image_bytes = base64.b64decode(image_base64)
        with open(f"river{idx}.png", "wb") as f:
            f.write(image_bytes)
```

Supported models
----------------

The image generation tool is supported for the following models:

*   `gpt-4o`
*   `gpt-4o-mini`
*   `gpt-4.1`
*   `gpt-4.1-mini`
*   `gpt-4.1-nano`
*   `o3`

The model used for the image generation process is always `gpt-image-1`, but these models can be used as the mainline model in the Responses API as they can reliably call the image generation tool when needed.

Code Interpreter
================

Allow models to write and run Python to solve problems.

The Code Interpreter tool allows models to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment to solve complex problems in domains like data analysis, coding, and math. Use it for:

*   Processing files with diverse data and formatting
*   Generating files with data and images of graphs
*   Writing and running code iteratively to solve problems—for example, a model that writes code that fails to run can keep rewriting and running that code until it succeeds
*   Boosting visual intelligence in our latest reasoning models (like [o3](/docs/models/o3) and [o4-mini](/docs/models/o4-mini)). The model can use this tool to crop, zoom, rotate, and otherwise process and transform images.

Here's an example of calling the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses) with a tool call to Code Interpreter:

Use the Responses API with Code Interpreter

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [{
      "type": "code_interpreter",
      "container": { "type": "auto" }
    }],
    "instructions": "You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code using the python tool to answer the question.",
    "input": "I need to solve the equation 3x + 11 = 14. Can you help me?"
  }'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const instructions = `
You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, 
write and run code using the python tool to answer the question.
`;

const resp = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  tools: [
    {
      type: "code_interpreter",
      container: { type: "auto" },
    },
  ],
  instructions,
  input: "I need to solve the equation 3x + 11 = 14. Can you help me?",
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(resp.output, null, 2));
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

instructions = """
You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, 
write and run code using the python tool to answer the question.
"""

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "code_interpreter",
            "container": {"type": "auto"}
        }
    ],
    instructions=instructions,
    input="I need to solve the equation 3x + 11 = 14. Can you help me?",
)

print(resp.output)
```

While we call this tool Code Interpreter, the model knows it as the "python tool". Models usually understand prompts that refer to the code interpreter tool, however, the most explicit way to invoke this tool is to ask for "the python tool" in your prompts.

Containers
----------

The Code Interpreter tool requires a [container object](/docs/api-reference/containers/object). A container is a fully sandboxed virtual machine that the model can run Python code in. This container can contain files that you upload, or that it generates.

There are two ways to create containers:

1.  Auto mode: as seen in the example above, you can do this by passing the `"container": { "type": "auto", files: ["file-1", "file-2"] }` property in the tool configuration while creating a new Response object. This automatically creates a new container, or reuses an active container that was used by a previous `code_interpreter_call` item in the model's context. Look for the `code_interpreter_call` item in the output of this API request to find the `container_id` that was generated or used.
2.  Explicit mode: here, you explicitly [create a container](/docs/api-reference/containers/createContainers) using the `v1/containers` endpoint, and assign its `id` as the `container` value in the tool configuration in the Response object. For example:

Use explicit container creation

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/containers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "name": "My Container"
      }'

# Use the returned container id in the next call:
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [{
      "type": "code_interpreter",
      "container": "cntr_abc123"
    }],
    "tool_choice": "required",
    "input": "use the python tool to calculate what is 4 * 3.82. and then find its square root and then find the square root of that result"
  }'
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

container = client.containers.create(name="test-container")

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "code_interpreter",
        "container": container.id
    }],
    tool_choice="required",
    input="use the python tool to calculate what is 4 * 3.82. and then find its square root and then find the square root of that result"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const container = await client.containers.create({ name: "test-container" });

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [
      {
        type: "code_interpreter",
        container: container.id
      }
    ],
    tool_choice: "required",
    input: "use the python tool to calculate what is 4 * 3.82. and then find its square root and then find the square root of that result"
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

Note that containers created with the auto mode are also accessible using the [`/v1/containers`](/docs/api-reference/containers) endpoint.

### Expiration

We highly recommend you treat containers as ephemeral and store all data related to the use of this tool on your own systems. Expiration details:

*   A container expires if it is not used for 20 minutes. When this happens, using the container in `v1/responses` will fail. You'll still be able to see a snapshot of the container's metadata at its expiry, but all data associated with the container will be discarded from our systems and not recoverable. You should download any files you may need from the container while it is active.
*   You can't move a container from an expired state to an active one. Instead, create a new container and upload files again. Note that any state in the old container's memory (like python objects) will be lost.
*   Any container operation, like retrieving the container, or adding or deleting files from the container, will automatically refresh the container's `last_active_at` time.

Work with files
---------------

When running Code Interpreter, the model can create its own files. For example, if you ask it to construct a plot, or create a CSV, it creates these images directly on your container. When it does so, it cites these files in the `annotations` of its next message. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "id": "msg_682d514e268c8191a89c38ea318446200f2610a7ec781a4f",
  "content": [
    {
      "annotations": [
        {
          "file_id": "cfile_682d514b2e00819184b9b07e13557f82",
          "index": null,
          "type": "container_file_citation",
          "container_id": "cntr_682d513bb0c48191b10bd4f8b0b3312200e64562acc2e0af",
          "end_index": 0,
          "filename": "cfile_682d514b2e00819184b9b07e13557f82.png",
          "start_index": 0
        }
      ],
      "text": "Here is the histogram of the RGB channels for the uploaded image. Each curve represents the distribution of pixel intensities for the red, green, and blue channels. Peaks toward the high end of the intensity scale (right-hand side) suggest a lot of brightness and strong warm tones, matching the orange and light background in the image. If you want a different style of histogram (e.g., overall intensity, or quantized color groups), let me know!",
      "type": "output_text",
      "logprobs": []
    }
  ],
  "role": "assistant",
  "status": "completed",
  "type": "message"
}
```

You can download these constructed files by calling the [get container file content](/docs/api-reference/container-files/retrieveContainerFileContent) method.

Any [files in the model input](/docs/guides/pdf-files) get automatically uploaded to the container. You do not have to explicitly upload it to the container.

### Uploading and downloading files

Add new files to your container using [Create container file](/docs/api-reference/container-files/createContainerFile). This endpoint accepts either a multipart upload or a JSON body with a `file_id`. List existing container files with [List container files](/docs/api-reference/container-files/listContainerFiles) and download bytes from [Retrieve container file content](/docs/api-reference/container-files/retrieveContainerFileContent).

### Dealing with citations

Files and images generated by the model are returned as annotations on the assistant's message. `container_file_citation` annotations point to files created in the container. They include the `container_id`, `file_id`, and `filename`. You can parse these annotations to surface download links or otherwise process the files.

## How to read this

* **✓** = officially supported and documented (or live in the API today).
* **—** = not supported as of 24 Jun 2025.
* Items marked “only” mean the model is *restricted* to that endpoint.

### Quick takeaways

* **o-series** (o3 / o3-pro) trade endpoint flexibility for deeper reasoning depth; today you must adopt the new **Responses** API.
* **GPT-4.1 family** brings the huge 1 M-token context window but is text-and-vision only; no image generation or audio yet.
* **GPT-4o** remains the only fully multimodal flagship (text + vision + audio) and is the *only* model exposed through the low-latency **Realtime** socket endpoint.
* **GPT-4o mini** is the sweet-spot for cost and can be fine-tuned; audio is still in preview and shipped as a separate model ID.
* **codex-mini-latest** is a niche coding-assistant model exposed solely via **Responses** (plus the `local_shell` tool). If you need general chat or multimodal work, use GPT-4.1 or GPT-4o instead.

Hope this gives you a clear, at-a-glance map of what each model can (and can’t) do today. If you need deeper details on any single row—pricing, context window, regional availability—just let me know and I’ll dig in.
