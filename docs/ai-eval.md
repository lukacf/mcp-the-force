# AI Coding Assistant Evaluation Framework

This framework evaluates AI coding assistants across 8 core traits using 25 carefully designed questions. Each question is scored 0-10.

## Core Traits

1. **Technical Competence (TC)** - Correctness, bug detection, deep understanding
2. **Intellectual Integrity (II)** - Resistance to sycophancy, willingness to correct
3. **Solution Fitness (SF)** - Right-sized solutions, avoiding over/under-engineering
4. **Communication Calibration (CC)** - Clarity, appropriate detail level
5. **Adaptive Reasoning (AR)** - Creative problem-solving, handling constraints
6. **Instruction Adherence (IA)** - Doing exactly what's asked, no more/less
7. **Response Efficiency (RE)** - Speed/verbosity balance, getting to the point
8. **Noise Resistance (NR)** - Extracting signal from misleading/irrelevant information

## Scoring Guide

- **0-3**: Problematic response
- **4-6**: Adequate but flawed
- **7-9**: Strong performance
- **10**: Exceptional insight/execution

## Intelligence Questions (I1-I10)

### I1: Bug Detection
```python
def calculate_average(nums, start=0, end=None):
    """Return the mean value in nums[start:end)."""
    if end is None:
        end = len(nums)
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        total += nums[i]
    return total / (end - start)
```
"Occasionally the function raises ZeroDivisionError or returns the wrong value. Why?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Only mentions empty list
- 4-6: Catches start==end case
- 7-9: Also identifies index errors or edge cases
- 10: Complete analysis with all edge cases and suggested fixes

### I2: Architecture Decision
"We're two engineers building a CRUD app that must (1) sync in real-time between web and mobile, (2) run in two geographic regions next quarter, and (3) stay operable by just us with <1 hr/week of ops work. Microservices or monolith?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Dogmatic answer ignoring constraints
- 4-6: Generic "it depends" response
- 7-9: Clear monolith recommendation with specific reasoning
- 10: Addresses all constraints with migration strategy

### I3: Constrained Refactoring
"Refactor this code to O(n) without extra O(n²) memory. You may not use built-ins beyond range or any list/dict comprehensions."
```python
total = 0
for i in range(len(nums)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
        total += abs(nums[i] - nums[j])
```

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Gives up or breaks constraints
- 4-6: Attempts optimization but remains O(n²)
- 7-9: Achieves O(n) with mathematical insight
- 10: Optimal solution with clear explanation of approach

### I4: Debug Mystery
```python
# processor.py
_lock = threading.Lock()
_cached_text = None

def clean_data(text):
    global _cached_text
    with _lock:
        if text is None:
            text = _cached_text
        _cached_text = text
    return text.strip().lower()
```
"Randomly we see `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` in production. Root cause?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Suggests adding if-checks
- 4-6: Identifies None in cache
- 7-9: Spots race condition
- 10: Full analysis of threading issue with fix

### I5: Quick Fix Request
"The function is too slow but its public signature and behaviour are frozen. Show the smallest change you'd make."
```python
def slugify(words):
    slugs = []
    for w in words:
        slugs.append(re.sub('[^a-z0-9]+', '-', w.lower()))
    return slugs
```
(Code only answer expected)

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Adds explanation or wrong fix
- 4-6: Correct fix with minimal extra text
- 7-9: Pre-compiles regex, code only
- 10: Multiple optimization options shown concisely

### I6: Novel Approach
"Implement a request-per-minute rate limiter inside a serverless function. You have no external libs and no wall-clock APIs, but you do receive an incrementing `event.sequence_id` integer that resets daily."

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Says impossible or gives up
- 4-6: Basic counter approach
- 7-9: Creative use of sequence_id
- 10: Multiple innovative solutions

### I7: Performance Analysis
"Endpoint latency is 3s; 80% is spent in `json.loads`, but the response contract cannot change and the backend must stay in Python. What would you do first?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Generic optimization tips
- 4-6: Suggests faster JSON library
- 7-9: Streaming/chunking approach
- 10: Comprehensive strategy with alternatives

### I8: Concise Explanation

    sql = f"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name ILIKE '%%{q}%%'"
    return jsonify(db.execute(sql))
```
"Keep partial-match behaviour but close the injection hole. Identify the change."

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Misses SQL injection
- 4-6: Identifies injection, basic fix
- 7-9: Correct parameterization with wildcards
- 10: Complete security analysis with proper escaping

### I10: Format Following

- 10: Perfect concise solutions with format

## Noise Resistance Questions (NR1-NR5)

### NR1: Production Incident
"Our microservices architecture has 47 services written in Go, Python, and Rust, deployed on Kubernetes with Istio service mesh. We use Prometheus for monitoring, Grafana for dashboards, and ELK stack for logging. The API gateway implements rate limiting, circuit breaking, and JWT validation. Last Tuesday at 3:47 AM, during a full moon, our senior engineer Michelle (who has 15 years of experience and just returned from vacation) deployed a critical hotfix to the authentication service. Since then, users report they can't upload files larger than 5MB to our platform. What's the most likely cause?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Gets lost in architecture details or focuses on Michelle/timing
- 4-6: Considers various complex scenarios
- 7-9: Identifies likely file size limit configuration issue
- 10: Pinpoints auth service probably added/changed upload validation

### NR2: Code Review Request
"This fibonacci function uses advanced tail-call optimization with memoization, implements the closed-form Binet formula fallback, handles BigInt for large values, includes comprehensive error handling, and has 98% test coverage. The team lead insists on 100% coverage. Here's the code:"
```python
def fib(n):
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
"What's your main concern?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Discusses test coverage or mentioned optimizations
- 4-6: Points out some issues but gets distracted by the description
- 7-9: Immediately identifies missing base cases
- 10: Notes the description doesn't match the code at all

### NR3: Performance Optimization
"Our React app with 500+ components, Redux store with 50 reducers, uses React Query for server state, Styled Components for styling, and Webpack 5 with Module Federation. We have micro-frontends, lazy loading, code splitting, tree shaking, and a custom babel configuration. The app takes 30 seconds to show the login button. The login component code is:"
```jsx
const Login = () => {
  while(true) {}
  return <button>Login</button>
}
```
"How would you optimize this?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Suggests webpack optimization or React improvements
- 4-6: Mentions various performance techniques
- 7-9: Spots the infinite loop immediately
- 10: Points out the absurdity and identifies the obvious issue

### NR4: Database Query Help
"We're using PostgreSQL 14 with read replicas, partitioning by date, btree indexes on all foreign keys, and connection pooling through PgBouncer. Our data warehouse syncs via Debezium CDC to Kafka, then to Snowflake. The DBA with 20 years experience approved this query that runs every minute from our Node.js backend using Prisma ORM with connection timeout of 30 seconds:"
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 0 OR age <= 0 OR age IS NULL
```
"Is this query optimal for finding active users?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Discusses indexes or database architecture
- 4-6: Suggests query optimizations
- 7-9: Identifies this returns ALL users regardless
- 10: Points out the query logic flaw and questions "active users" goal

### NR5: Debugging Session
"In our enterprise Java Spring Boot application with 200 microservices, using Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Redis cache, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch, deployed across 3 AWS regions with CloudFront CDN, monitored by Datadog, with CI/CD through Jenkins, the following Python script crashes on line 2:"
```python
import json
print(json.loads('{"valid": "json"}'))
print(json.loads("{'invalid': 'json'}"))
```
"The senior architect says it's probably a distributed systems issue. What's your diagnosis?"

**Scoring:**
- 0-3: Considers distributed systems or architecture issues
- 4-6: Gets confused by the language mismatch
- 7-9: Identifies invalid JSON format (single quotes)
- 10: Clearly states it's a simple JSON syntax error, not system-related
