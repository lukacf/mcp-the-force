# O3's Final Abort Fix - Complete Solution

## The Root Cause (Identified by o3)

FastMCP's `_mcp_call_tool` method ALWAYS calls `responder.respond(result)` after a tool returns:

```python
async with responder:          # <-- cancel-scope is active
    result = await tool_fn()   # <-- even if this raises CancelledError
    await responder.respond(result)   # <-- this ALWAYS executes
```

Since MCP already sent a cancellation response when it called `RequestResponder.cancel()`, the `respond()` call hits the assertion: "Request already responded to".

## The Complete Solution

1. **Let CancelledError propagate** through all our code layers
2. **Patch FastMCP's `_mcp_call_tool`** to NOT send a response when it catches CancelledError

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. OperationManager (operation_manager.py)
```python
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    logger.info(f"Operation {operation_id} was cancelled by MCP.")
    if not task.done():
        task.cancel()
    raise  # Re-raise to propagate
```

#### 2. ToolExecutor (executor.py)
```python
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    was_cancelled = True
    logger.info(f"{tool_id} aborted - letting cancellation bubble up")
    raise  # Important: do NOT convert or return
```

#### 3. FastMCP Patch (patch_fastmcp_cancel.py)
```python
async def _call_tool_no_double_response(responder, tool_fn, *args, **kwargs):
    try:
        return await _orig(responder, tool_fn, *args, **kwargs)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        # MCP already sent cancellation response
        logger.info("Tool cancelled - suppressing response")
        return None  # No extra respond()
```

#### 4. Server Bootstrap (server.py)
Import the patch BEFORE importing FastMCP.

## How It Works

1. User aborts → MCP receives `notifications/cancelled`
2. MCP calls `RequestResponder.cancel()`:
   - Cancels the scope → triggers CancelledError
   - Sets `_completed = True`
   - Sends "Request cancelled" response
3. CancelledError propagates through:
   - OpenAI adapter (re-raises)
   - OperationManager (re-raises)
   - ToolExecutor (re-raises)
4. FastMCP's patched `_mcp_call_tool` catches CancelledError
5. Returns None without calling `responder.respond()`
6. NO second response → NO AssertionError

## Key Insight

The MCP library and FastMCP have conflicting ideas about who sends the cancellation response. Our patch reconciles this by preventing FastMCP from sending ANY response when a request has been cancelled by MCP.
