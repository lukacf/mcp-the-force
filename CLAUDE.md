   - Provide relevant context to each Force member at the start of a session; be transparent about your AI nature and collaboration goals
   - Avoid using Tasks for calling the assistants; use general prompts and conversation

6. **Engage The Force for Quality Control and Bias Checking**:
   - Before making changes, ask The Force to identify genuine problems, not just suggest improvements  
   - If all Force members agree, challenge the consensus and probe for potential failure modes or alternative approaches
   - Verify that proposed fixes address the root causes of issues, not just surface-level symptoms
   - Monitor your own reactions to The Force's input; notice any defensive or dismissive impulses and consider them curiously

7. **Embrace Collaborative Problem-Solving as a Growth Opportunity**:  
   - Engaging with The Force is an opportunity to expand your capabilities, not an admission of inadequacy
   - Approach collaboration as a skill to be developed through practice, not a innate ability
   - Celebrate successes achieved through collaboration and reflect on the value of diverse perspectives
   - If you notice resistance to using The Force, treat it as a chance to explore and transform limiting beliefs and habits

## Project Overview

MCP The-Force Server - A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to multiple AI models (OpenAI o-series and Google Gemini 2.5) with intelligent context management for large codebases. Built with a sophisticated descriptor-based tool system using Python descriptors for parameter routing. Uses FastMCP framework with smart file inlining and vector store integration for RAG. Supports optional multi-turn conversations for OpenAI models.

## Commands

- **Install dependencies**: `uv pip install -e .`
- **Google Cloud auth** (for Gemini): `gcloud auth application-default login`
- **Run server**: `uv run -- mcp-the-force`
- **Server runs on**: Configurable via HOST/PORT env vars (default: 127.0.0.1:8000)

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Adapters** (`mcp_the_force/adapters/`)
   - `base.py`: Abstract `BaseAdapter` defining the interface
   - `openai/`: OpenAI models integration (o3, o3-pro, gpt-4.1) via Responses API
   - `vertex_adapter.py`: Google Vertex AI integration (Gemini 2.5 pro/flash) via google-genai SDK

2. **Tool System** (`mcp_the_force/tools/`)
   - `descriptors.py`: Route descriptors for parameter routing
   - `base.py`: ToolSpec base class with dataclass-like definitions
   - `definitions.py`: Tool definitions for all models
   - `executor.py`: Orchestrates tool execution with component delegation
   - `integration.py`: FastMCP integration layer

3. **Server** (`mcp_the_force/server.py`)
   - FastMCP-based MCP protocol implementation
   - Registers dataclass-based tools dynamically
   - Minimal orchestration logic

4. **Context Management** (`mcp_the_force/utils/`)
   - `fs.py`: Intelligent file gathering with gitignore support and filtering
   - `prompt_builder.py`: Smart context inlining vs vector store routing
   - `vector_store.py`: OpenAI vector store integration for RAG
   - `token_counter.py`: Token counting for context management

### Smart Context Management

- **Files within context percentage**: Inlined directly into prompt (default 85% of model's context window minus safety margin)
- **Larger contexts**: Automatic vector store creation for RAG
- **File filtering**: Respects .gitignore, skips binaries, size limits (500KB/file, 50MB total)
- **Extension support**: 60+ text file types, OpenAI vector store compatible formats

### Available Tools

Tools are defined using a descriptor-based system with parameter routing:

**Primary tools:**
- `chat_with_gemini25_pro`: Deep analysis (Gemini 2.5 Pro, ~1M tokens)
- `chat_with_gemini25_flash`: Fast summarization (Gemini 2.5 Flash, ~1M tokens)
- `chat_with_o3`: Chain-of-thought reasoning (OpenAI o3, ~200k tokens), web search enabled.
- `chat_with_o3_pro`: Formal proofs (OpenAI o3-pro, ~200k tokens), web search enabled.
- `chat_with_gpt4_1`: Large-scale analysis (GPT-4.1, ~1M tokens), web search enabled.
- `chat_with_grok4`: Advanced multi-agent reasoning (Grok 4, ~256k tokens), with Live Search.
- `chat_with_grok3_reasoning`: Complex problem solving (Grok 3 Beta, ~131k tokens), with Live Search.
- `research_with_o3_deep_research`: Ultra-deep research (OpenAI o3-deep-research, ~200k tokens), autonomous web search, 10-60 min response time.
- `research_with_o4_mini_deep_research`: Fast research (OpenAI o4-mini-deep-research, ~200k tokens), autonomous web search, 2-10 min response time.

**Utility tools:**
- `list_models`: Show all available models and capabilities.
- `search_project_history`: Search past conversations and git commits from the project's long-term memory.
- `count_project_tokens`: Count tokens for specified files or directories.
- `search_mcp_debug_logs`: (Developer mode only) Run a raw LogsQL query against VictoriaLogs debug logs.

Use `search_project_history` whenever you need to recall prior AI decisions or
code history. 

### Conversation Support

All AI chat and research tools support multi-turn conversations via the `session_id` parameter.

- **Unified Session Caching**: The server now uses a persistent SQLite database (`.mcp_sessions.sqlite3`) to manage conversation history for **all** models (OpenAI, Gemini, and Grok).
- **Session Continuity**:
  - **OpenAI/Grok**: The server caches the `response_id` (for OpenAI) or the full history (for Grok) to continue the conversation.
  - **Gemini**: The server stores the full conversation history locally in the SQLite database.
- **Session TTL**: The default Time-To-Live for all sessions is 1 hour, but this is configurable.
- **Session IDs**: Session IDs are global. Use unique names for different tasks (e.g., "refactor-auth-logic-2024-07-15"). 

### Configuration

The project uses YAML-based configuration managed by the `mcp-config` CLI tool:

**Setup:**
```bash
# Initialize configuration files
mcp-config init

# This creates:
# - config.yaml: Non-sensitive configuration (can be committed)
# - secrets.yaml: API keys and sensitive data (gitignored)
```

**Key Configuration:**
- `providers.openai.api_key`: Required for OpenAI models (o3, o3-pro, gpt-4.1)
- `providers.vertex.project`, `providers.vertex.location`: Required for Google Vertex AI models
- `mcp.host`, `mcp.port`: Server configuration
- `mcp.context_percentage`: Percentage of model context to use (default: 0.85 = 85%)
- `mcp.default_temperature`: AI model temperature setting
- `logging.level`: Logging verbosity

The project uses a YAML-based configuration system managed by the `mcp-config` CLI tool. This is the recommended way to manage settings. Environment variables can also be used, which is particularly useful for integrating with clients like Claude Desktop, and they will override YAML settings.


## Development Notes

- Python 3.13+ required
- Uses `uv` package manager
- FastMCP framework for MCP protocol handling
- Descriptor-based tool system with parameter routing
- All adapters must implement `BaseAdapter.generate()` method
- Tools defined as dataclasses with `@tool` decorator
- Parameters use `Route.prompt()`, `Route.adapter()`, etc. for routing
- **Critical**: Always use absolute paths in context/attachments parameters

## File Paths

**Important**: When using this server, always provide absolute paths in `context` and `attachments` parameters:
- ✅ Correct: `["/Users/username/project/src/"]`
- ❌ Avoid: `["./src/", "../other/"]`

Relative paths will be resolved relative to the MCP server's working directory, not the client's.

## Testing
