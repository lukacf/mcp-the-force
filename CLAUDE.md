## Project Overview

MCP The-Force Server - A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to multiple AI models (OpenAI o-series, Google Gemini 2.5, and xAI Grok) with intelligent context management for large codebases. Built with a sophisticated descriptor-based tool system using Python descriptors for parameter routing. Uses FastMCP framework with smart file inlining and vector store integration for RAG. Supports multi-turn conversations for all models via UnifiedSessionCache.

## Commands

- **Install dependencies**: `uv pip install -e .`
- **Google Cloud auth** (for Gemini): `gcloud auth application-default login`
- **Run server**: `uv run -- mcp-the-force`
- **Server runs on**: Configurable via HOST/PORT env vars (default: 127.0.0.1:8000)

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Adapters** (`mcp_the_force/adapters/`)
   - Protocol-based architecture with `MCPAdapter` protocol
   - `openai/`: OpenAI models integration (o3, o3-pro, o4-mini, gpt-4.1) via Responses API
   - `google/`: Google Vertex AI integration (Gemini 2.5 pro/flash) via google-genai SDK
   - `xai/`: xAI integration (Grok 3 Beta, Grok 4)
   - `registry.py`: Central adapter registry

2. **Tool System** (`mcp_the_force/tools/`)
   - `descriptors.py`: Route descriptors with capability requirements
   - `base.py`: ToolSpec base class with dataclass-like definitions
   - `autogen.py`: Automatic tool generation from adapter blueprints
   - `executor.py`: Orchestrates tool execution with capability validation
   - `capability_validator.py`: Validates parameters against model capabilities
   - `factories.py`: Dynamic tool class generation
   - `integration.py`: FastMCP integration layer

3. **Server** (`mcp_the_force/server.py`)
   - FastMCP-based MCP protocol implementation
   - Registers dataclass-based tools dynamically
   - Minimal orchestration logic

4. **Context Management** (`mcp_the_force/utils/`)
   - `fs.py`: Intelligent file gathering with gitignore support and filtering
   - `prompt_builder.py`: Smart context inlining vs vector store routing
   - `vector_store.py`: OpenAI vector store integration for RAG
   - `token_counter.py`: Token counting for context management

### Smart Context Management

- **Files within context percentage**: Inlined directly into prompt (default 85% of model's context window minus safety margin)
- **Larger contexts**: Automatic vector store creation for RAG
- **File filtering**: Respects .gitignore, skips binaries, size limits (500KB/file, 50MB total)
- **Extension support**: 60+ text file types, OpenAI vector store compatible formats

### Available Tools

The Force provides access to 17 cutting-edge AI models through `chat_with_*` tools, each with dynamically-generated descriptions showing their capabilities, context limits, and best use cases.

**Key models for most tasks:**
- For 90% of your work, use **`chat_with_gpt5`** (smartest, 400k context) or **`chat_with_gemini25_pro`** (smart, 1M context, fast)
- For fast large-context work: **`chat_with_gemini25_flash`** or **`chat_with_gpt41`**
- For search: **`chat_with_gpt5`** is best, but **`chat_with_grok4`** is good and faster

**Utility tools:**
- `list_sessions`: List existing AI conversation sessions for the current project
- `describe_session`: Generate an AI-powered summary of an existing session's conversation history
- `search_project_history`: Search past conversations and git commits from the project's long-term history
- `count_project_tokens`: Count tokens for specified files or directories
- `search_mcp_debug_logs`: (Developer mode only) Run a raw LogsQL query against VictoriaLogs debug logs

Use `search_project_history` whenever you need to recall prior AI decisions or code history. 

### Conversation Support

All AI chat and research tools support multi-turn conversations via the `session_id` parameter.

- **Unified Session Caching**: The server now uses a persistent SQLite database (`.mcp-the-force/sessions.sqlite3`) to manage conversation history for **all** models (OpenAI, Gemini, and Grok).
- **Session Continuity**:
  - **OpenAI/Grok**: The server caches the `response_id` (for OpenAI) or the full history (for Grok) to continue the conversation.
  - **Gemini**: The server stores the full conversation history locally in the SQLite database.
- **Session TTL**: The default Time-To-Live for all sessions is 6 months (configurable via `session.ttl_seconds`).
- **Session IDs**: Session IDs are global. Use unique names for different tasks (e.g., "refactor-auth-logic-2024-07-15"). 

### Configuration

The project uses YAML-based configuration managed by the `mcp-config` CLI tool:

**Setup:**
```bash
# Initialize configuration files
mcp-config init

# This creates:
# - config.yaml: Non-sensitive configuration (can be committed)
# - secrets.yaml: API keys and sensitive data (gitignored)
```

**Key Configuration:**
- `providers.openai.api_key`: Required for OpenAI models (o3, o3-pro, o4-mini, gpt-4.1)
- `providers.vertex.project`, `providers.vertex.location`: Required for Google Vertex AI models
- `providers.xai.api_key`: Required for xAI models (Grok 3 Beta, Grok 4)
- `mcp.host`, `mcp.port`: Server configuration
- `mcp.context_percentage`: Percentage of model context to use (default: 0.85 = 85%)
- `mcp.default_temperature`: AI model temperature setting
- `logging.level`: Logging verbosity
- `session.ttl_seconds`: Session time-to-live (default: 15552000 = 6 months)
- `history.enabled`: Enable/disable long-term history system

The project uses a YAML-based configuration system managed by the `mcp-config` CLI tool. This is the recommended way to manage settings. Environment variables can also be used, which is particularly useful for integrating with clients like Claude Desktop, and they will override YAML settings.


## Development Notes

- Python 3.13+ required
- Uses `uv` package manager
- FastMCP framework for MCP protocol handling
- Descriptor-based tool system with parameter routing
- All adapters must implement `BaseAdapter.generate()` method
- Tools defined as dataclasses with `@tool` decorator
- Parameters use `Route.prompt()`, `Route.adapter()`, etc. for routing
- **Critical**: Always use absolute paths in context parameters

## File Paths

**Important**: When using this server, always provide absolute paths in `context` parameters:
- ✅ Correct: `["/Users/username/project/src/"]`
- ❌ Avoid: `["./src/", "../other/"]`

Relative paths will be resolved relative to the MCP server's working directory, not the client's.

## Testing
