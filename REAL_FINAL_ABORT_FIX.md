# The REAL Final Fix - Understanding MCP's Cancellation Protocol

## The Complete Picture

When Claude Code aborts:
1. Sends abort signal to abort controller
2. Sends `notifications/cancelled` to MCP server
3. MCP's `RequestResponder.cancel()` method:
   - Calls `_cancel_scope.cancel()` â†’ triggers CancelledError in our code
   - Sets `_completed = True` 
   - **Sends an error response: "Request cancelled"**

## The Problem

Our ToolExecutor was re-raising CancelledError, which caused FastMCP to try to send ANOTHER response. But MCP had already sent the cancellation response, leading to "Request already responded to".

## The Solution

We need to catch CancelledError but NOT re-raise it. Instead, we should return normally (not with empty string, as that sends a success response).

Actually, this is getting complex. The issue is that:
- If we return empty string, FastMCP sends a success response (wrong)
- If we re-raise CancelledError, FastMCP tries to send an error response (but MCP already sent one)
- If we return None or don't return, FastMCP might still try to send something

The real issue is that the MCP library is handling cancellation at a lower level than FastMCP expects.

## The Actual Fix

We need to check if the request was already cancelled before trying to send any response. The MCP library sets `_completed = True` when it sends the cancellation response.
