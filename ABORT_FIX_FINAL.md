# Final Abort Fix Summary

## Problem
When Claude Code aborts a long-running MCP tool call (e.g., by the user clicking the stop button), the MCP server would crash because:
1. The client disconnects abruptly without sending a proper cancellation request
2. The server tries to send a response after the client has disconnected
3. This causes write errors that crash the server

## Solution
We implemented three complementary patches that are applied before any MCP modules are imported:

### 1. Write Safety Patch (`patch_write_safety.py`)
- Wraps write operations to gracefully handle disconnection errors
- Catches BrokenPipeError, ConnectionResetError, and similar errors
- Returns None instead of raising when writes fail due to disconnection

### 2. MCP Responder Patch (`patch_mcp_responder.py`)
- Patches `RequestResponder.respond()` to handle disconnection errors
- When a client has disconnected, logs the error and suppresses it
- Prevents the server from crashing when trying to send responses to disconnected clients

### 3. FastMCP Cancellation Patch (`patch_fastmcp_cancel.py`)
- Patches FastMCP's `_mcp_call_tool` method to properly handle CancelledError
- Logs when a tool execution is cancelled and re-raises the error
- Ensures proper cancellation semantics are maintained

## Result
The server now gracefully handles Claude Code aborts:
- No more crashes when users click the stop button
- Tool executions are properly cancelled
- Server remains running and ready for new requests
- All error responses are suppressed when the client has disconnected

## Testing
Run `./test_exact_abort.py` to verify the fix. The server should remain running after the simulated abort.
