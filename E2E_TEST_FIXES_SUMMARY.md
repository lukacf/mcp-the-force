# E2E Test Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve E2E test failures.

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Vector Store Cleanup (High Priority) ✅
- Added `created_vector_stores` fixture in `tests/e2e/conftest.py` to track and cleanup vector stores
- Updated tests in `test_attachment_search_real.py` to use the fixture:
  - `test_search_finds_specific_content`
  - `test_multiple_queries` 
  - `test_context_isolation`
- Updated `test_vector_store_workflow` in `test_scenarios.py` to track created stores
- Cleanup now happens automatically after test session completes

### 2. Docker Build Optimization ✅
- Created `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from Docker build context
- This reduces build size and prevents cache ownership issues

### 3. Pytest Configuration Improvements ✅
- Changed timeout method from `thread` to `signal` in `tests/e2e/pytest.ini`
- Added `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function` to fix pytest-asyncio deprecation warning

### 4. Test Reliability ✅
- All vector store tests now properly track and cleanup created stores
- No more orphaned vector stores after test runs

## Notes

### Hardcoded Session IDs
- E2E tests in `test_scenarios.py` already use UUID-generated session IDs
- Internal tests have hardcoded session IDs but use mocked adapters, so no conflict

### JSON Shell Quoting
- Current implementation uses `shlex.quote()` on entire prompt, which is safe
- Piping JSON via stdin would be more complex and isn't necessary for current test cases

### tmp_path vs tmp_path_factory
- Current uses of `tmp_path` are appropriate for function-scoped fixtures/tests
- No changes needed

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Attachment-based vector stores**: When using the `attachments` parameter in tools, vector stores are created internally but not tracked for cleanup. This would require modifying the tool executor to return created vector store IDs.

2. **Pydantic deprecation warnings**: The codebase has some Pydantic v1-style configurations that trigger deprecation warnings. These should be updated to use v2 style in a separate effort.

## Test Results

All vector store cleanup tests now pass successfully and properly clean up resources:
- Vector stores are tracked during creation
- Cleanup happens automatically after test session
- No more orphaned resources
