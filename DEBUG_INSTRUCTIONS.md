# Debugging MCP Server Cancellation

## Setup

The server now has debug hooks that will trace all task cancellations and MCP operations to `mcp_debug_trace.log`.

## To Debug Cancellation:

1. **In Terminal 1**: Watch the debug log
   ```bash
   tail -f mcp_debug_trace.log
   ```

2. **In Terminal 2**: Watch the cancellation debug log
   ```bash
   tail -f mcp_cancellation_debug.log
   ```

3. **In Claude Code**: 
   - Start using the second brain normally
   - Run a long operation (e.g., o3 query)
   - Abort it
   - Check the logs to see what happened

## What to Look For:

1. **TASK CANCEL** entries show when and where tasks are being cancelled
2. **WAIT_FOR** entries show timeout operations
3. **MCP HANDLER** entries show MCP message flow
4. The exact timing between abort and cancellation

## Finding the Running Server:

Run this to find the MCP server process:
```bash
python find_mcp_pid.py
```

## Advanced Debugging:

To run with remote debugging support:
```bash
uv run -- python debug_server.py
```

Then connect a debugger to port 5678.
